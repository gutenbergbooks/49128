<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In selecting and arranging this collection of “Street Papers” for publication, every care has been taken to print them
<i>verbatim et literatim</i>. They all bear the printer’s name and address were such is used, and, in many cases, the wood-cuts have
either been borrowed or purchased for the purpose of presenting them in their original style. The real object being to show, in
the most genuine state, the character and quality of the productions written expressly for the amusement of the lower orders by
street-authors. The general instruction given to our printer has been to “set up word for word from copy, with the exception of
sɹǝʇʇǝʃ pǝuɹnʇ (<i>sic</i>) and those of a W<span class="smcap">R</span>O<i>n</i>g <i>F</i>oN<span class="smcap">T</span> (?)”&mdash;it being thought quite unnecessary to repeat these <i>convenient</i> and at that
time <i>compulsory</i> “Errors of the Press” and which were very common in former days with the printers and publishers of street
and public-house literature; arising alike from a want of skill in the art, a deficiency of capital, and the hurried manner in which
they were prepared and worked off to meet the momentary demand.</p>

<p>Old “Jemmy” Catnach&mdash;whose name is ever associated with the literature of our streets&mdash;was a man who hated “innowations,”
as he used to call improvements, and had a great horror of buying type, because, as he used to observe, he kept no standing
formes, and when certain sorts run short, he was not particular, and would tell the boys to use anything which would make a
good shift. For instance, he never considered a compositor could be aground for a lowercase l while he had a figure of 1 or a cap.
I to fall back upon; by the same rule, the cap. O and figure 0 were synonymous with “Jemmy;” the lower-case p, b, d, and q,
would all do duty for each other in <i>turn</i>, and if they could not always find roman letters to finish a word with, why the compositor
knew very well that the “reader” would not mark out ita<i>lic</i>.</p>

<p>At the time Catnach commenced business. “Johnny” Pitts,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the Toy and Marble Warehouse, No. 6, Great St. Andrew
Street, was the acknowledged and established Printer of Street-Literature for the “Dials” district; therefore, as may be easily
imagined, a powerful rivalry and vindictive jealousy soon arose between these “two of a trade”&mdash;most especially on the part of
“Old Mother” Pitts, who is described as being a coarse and vulgar-minded personage, and as having originally followed the trade
of a bumboat woman at Portsmouth: she “vowed vengeance against the young fellow in the court for daring to set up in their
business, and also spoke of him as young “Catsnatch,” “Catblock,” “Cut-throat,” and many other opprobrious terms being freely
given to the new comer. Pitts’ staff of “bards” were duly cautioned of the consequences which would inevitably follow should
they dare to write a line for Catnach&mdash;the new <i>cove</i> in the court. The injunction was for a time obeyed, but the “Seven Bards of
the Dials” soon found it not only convenient, but also more profitable to sell copies of their effusions to both sides at the same
time, and by keeping their own council they avoided detection, as each printer accused the other of buying an early sold copy,
and then reprinting it off with the utmost speed, and which was in reality often the case, as “Both Houses” had an emissary on
the constant look-out for any new production suitable for street-sale. Now, although this style of “Double dealing” and competition
tended much to lessen the cost price to the “middle-man,” or vendor, the public in this case did not get any of the
reduction, as a penny broadside was still a penny, and a quarter sheet still a halfpenny to them, the “street-patterer” obtaining
the whole of the reduction as extra profit.</p>

<p>The feud existing between these rival publishers, who have been somewhat aptly designated as the Colburn and Bentley of
the “paper” trade, never abated, but, on the contrary, increased in acrimony of temper until at last not being content to vilify
each other by words alone, they resorted to printing off virulent lampoons, in which Catnach never failed to let the world know
that “Old Mother Pitts” had been formerly a bumboat woman, while the Pitts announced that&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At length Catnach, from the possession of greater capital and business acumen, became&mdash;to use the words of our informant&mdash;“the
Cock of the Walk,” and continued so until his retirement in 1839. In his Will&mdash;or <span class="smcap">Last Dying Speech</span>&mdash;which was
proved April, 1842, “James Catnach, of Dancer’s Hill, South Mimms, in the county of Middlesex, gentleman, formerly of Monmouth
Court, Monmouth Street, printer, bequeathed the whole of his estate to his sister Anne, the widow of Joseph Ryle, in trust,
nevertheless, for her daughter, Marion Martha Ryle, until she obtain the age of twenty-one years. Witnesses&mdash;William Kinsey,
13, Suffolk St., Pall Mall, Solr. Wm. Tookey his clerk.”</p>

<p>The present street literature printers and publishers are Mr. W. S. Fortey (Catnach’s successor), of 2 and 3, Monmouth
Court, Seven Dials. Mr. Henry Disley (formerly with Catnach), 57, High Street, St. Giles’s. Mr. Taylor, Brick Lane, Spitalfields.
Mr. H. Such, 177, Union Street, Borough; and Mr. J. Harkness, 121, Church Street, Preston. From whose “establishments”
upwards of two thousand street “papers” and “ballads” have been obtained, and from which&mdash;together with a private collection&mdash;we
have made our selection to form “<span class="smcap">The Curiosities of Street Literature</span>.”</p>

<p>With such a vast amount of “material” to hand, it is somewhat difficult to know which to retain and which to reject. It
being utterly impossible to reproduce the whole, the only thing to be done is to make the attempt to divide them into something
like classes. We have, therefore, arranged our collection into four divisions, which may be briefly alluded to as&mdash;I. <span class="smcap">“Cocks,” or
“Catchpennies.”</span> II. <span class="smcap">Royalty and Political.</span> III. <span class="smcap">Ballads on a Subject.</span> IV. <span class="smcap">Dying Speech and Confessional
Papers.</span></p>

<p>During the progress of our “Collection” through the press, we had, by a special appointment, an interview with Mr. John
Morgan, a street author, and who may be said to be the oldest of his peculiar class. “I’m the last one left of our old crew, Sir,”
he observed during our conversation. He is now upwards of 70 years of age, and formerly wrote for “Old Jemmy” Catnach,
with whose personal history he is well acquainted, and still continues to write for the “Seven Dials Press.” A street ballad from
his pen will be found at page 103 of our work. In allusion to Mr. John Morgan, the writer of an article on “Street Ballads” in
the <i>National Review</i> for October, 1861, makes the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This ballad&mdash;‘Little Lord John out of Service’&mdash;is one of the few which bear a signature. It is signed ‘John Morgan’
in the copy which we possess. For a long time we believed this name to be a mere <i>nom-de-plume</i>; but the other day, when
making a small purchase in Monmouth Court, we were informed, in answer to a casual question, that this is the real name of the
author of some of the best comic ballads. Our informant added, that he is an elderly, we may say old, gentleman, living somewhere
in Westminster; but the exact whereabouts we could not discover. Mr. Morgan followed no particular visible calling so
far as our informant knew, except writing ballads, by which he could not earn much of a livelihood, as the price of an original
ballad, in these buying-cheap days, has been screwed down by publishers to somewhere about a shilling sterling. Something
more like bread-and-butter might be made perhaps by poets who were in the habit of singing their own ballads, as some of them
do, but not Mr. Morgan. Should this ever meet the eye of that gentleman (a not very probable event, we fear), we beg to apologise
for the liberty we have taken in using the verses and name, and hope he will excuse us, having regard to the subject in which we
are his humble fellow-labourers. We could scarcely avoid naming him, the fact being that he is the only living author of street
ballads whose name we know. That self-denying mind, indifferent to worldly fame, which characterised the architects of our
cathedrals and abbeys, would seem to have descended on our ballad-writers; and we must be thankful, therefore, to be able to
embalm and hand down to posterity a name here and there, such as William of Wykeham, and John Morgan. In answer to our
inquiries in this matter, generally we have been told, ‘Oh, anybody writes them’ and with that answer we have had to rest satisfied.
But in presence of that answer, we walk about the streets with a new sense of wonder, peering into the faces of those of
our fellow-lieges who do not carry about with them the external evidence of overflowing exchequers, and saying to ourselves,
‘That man may be a writer of ballads.’</p>

<p>With regard to illustrations, a ballad-printer is in the habit of buying up old wood-cuts which have been engraved for any
other works, and of applying them to his own purposes; disregarding alike their age, rudeness, and condition. Most of those
adopted are repeatedly employed over and over again. The printers of “broadsides” seldom care whether an ornament of the kind
used is, or not, appropriate to the subject of the ballad, so long as it is likely to attract attention. Many examples will be found
in this collection, and we are indebted to Mr. H. Disley and others for the use of the same.</p>

<p>“The authors and poets who give this peculiar literature, alike in prose or rhyme to the streets, are all in some capacity or
another connected with street-patter or song; and the way in which a narrative or a ‘copy of werses’ is prepared for the press is
usually this:&mdash;The leading members of the ‘schools’&mdash;some of whom refer regularly to the evening papers&mdash;when they hear of any
out-of-the-way occurrence, resort to the printer and desire its publication in a style proper for the streets. This is usually done
very speedily, the school&mdash;or a majority of them&mdash;and the printer agreeing with the author. Sometimes an author will voluntarily
prepare a piece of street-literature and submit it to a publisher, who, as in case of other publishers, accepts or declines, as he believes
the production will or will not prove remunerative. Sometimes the school carry the manuscript with them to the printer, and
undertake to buy a certain quantity to insure publication. The payment to the author is the same in all cases&mdash;a shilling; but
sometimes if the printer and publisher like the verses he “throws a penny or two over.” And sometimes also, in case of a great
sale there is the same “over-sum.” The “Dials” and its immediate neighbourhood is the chief residence of these parties, as being
nearest to the long-established printer they have made it the ‘head meet’ of the fraternity.</p>

<p>“It must be borne in mind that the street-author is closely restricted in the quality of his effusions. It must be such as the
patterers approve, as the chanters can chant, the ballad singers sing, and&mdash;above all, such as the street buyers will buy.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>We have recently met, near the Strand, the street ballad singer of our youth, and, from whom we procured, “Wait for the
Turn of the Tide,” and “Call her back and Kiss Her,” and the following information&mdash;“Oh, yes, I remember you, remember you
well; particularly when I see you down at Brighton; when you treated me to that hot rum and water; when I was so wet and
cold, at a little snug public-house in one of the streets that leads off the main street. I don’t remember the name on it now, but
I remembers the rum and water well enough; it was good. You said it would be, and so it was, and no mistake. How old am I
now? Why, 59. How long have I been at it? Why, hard on fifty years. I was about nine or ten year old&mdash;no, perhaps I might
have been 12 year old, when I come to think on it. Yes, about 12 year old; my mother was a widow with five children, and
there was a boy in our street as used to go out singing ballads, and his mother said to my mother, ‘Why don’t you let your boy
(that’s me) go out and sing ballads like my boy.’ And I said I didn’t mind, and I did go out, and I’ve been at it ever since, so
you see it ’aint far short of 50 year. How many do I sell in a day? Well, not so many as I used to do, by a long way. I’ve
sold me four and five quires a-day, but I don’t sell above two and three dozen a-day now. That’s all the difference you see, sir&mdash;dozens
against quires. How do I live then? Why, you see I am now so well-known in different parts of London, that lots and
lots of people comes up to me&mdash;like you always do&mdash;and says&mdash;‘How do you do, old fellow? I remember you when I was a boy,
if its a man, and when I was a girl, if its a woman.’ And says, ‘So you are still selling songs, eh?’ Then they give me a few
coppers; some more and some less than others, and says they don’t want the songs. Some days&mdash;very often&mdash;I’ve had more
money giving me than I’ve took for the ballads. Yes, I have travelled all over England&mdash;all over it I think&mdash;but the North’s
the best&mdash;Manchester, Liverpool, and them towns; but down Bath and Cheltenham way I was nearly starved. I was coming
back from that way, I now remember, when I met you, sir, at Brighton that time. I buy my ballads at various places&mdash;but now
mostly over the water, because I live there now and it’s handiest. Mr. Such, the printer, in Union-street in the Borough. Oh!
yes, some at Catnach’s&mdash;leastways, it ain’t Catnach’s now, it’s Fortey’s. Yes, I remember ‘old Jemmy Catnach’ very well; he
wa’n’t a bad sort, as you say; leastways, I’ve heard so, but I never had anything of him. I always paid for what I had, and did
not say much to him, or he to me&mdash;writing his life of him, are you indeed? No, I can’t give you no more information about
him than that, because, as I said before, I bought my goods as I wanted them, and paid for them, then away on my own account
and business. Well, he was a man something like you&mdash;a little wider across the shoulders, perhaps, but about such a man as you
are. I did know a man as could have told you a lot about ‘old Jemmy,’ but he’s dead now; he was one of his authors, that is,
he wrote some of the street-ballads for him, and very good ones they used to be, that is, for selling. Want some old ‘Dying
Speeches’ and ‘Cocks,’ do you indeed; well, I a’nt got any&mdash;I don’t often ‘work’ them things, although I have done so sometimes,
but I mostly keep to the old game&mdash;‘Ballads on a Subject.’ You see them other things are no use only just for the day,
then they are no use at all, so we don’t keep them&mdash;I’ve often given them away. You’d give sixpence a piece for them, would
you, indeed, sir; then I wish I had some of them. Now I come to think of it I know a man that did have a lot of them bye
him, and I know he’d be glad to sell them. I don’t know where he lives, but I sometimes see him. Oh! yes, a letter would
find me. My name is Samuel Milnes, and I live at No. 81, Mint-street, that’s in the Borough; you know, Guager is the name at
the house. Thank you, sir, I’m much obliged. Good day, sir.”</p>

<p>It will be seen that our street-ballads and “papers” come down to the latest period, several being issued during the printing
of this collection; in fact, any public affair seems of sufficient importance to write a ballad about. We have, therefore, placed
some blank leaves between each division, for the purpose of mounting other examples that may be from time to time published
by the printers of Street Literature.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>“<span class="smcap">Cocks</span>&mdash;fictitious narratives, in verse or prose, of murders, fires, and terrible accidents, sold in the streets as true accounts.
The man who hawks them, a patterer, often changes the scene of the awful event to suit the taste of the neighbourhood he is
trying to delude. Possibly a corruption of <span class="smcap">Cook</span>, a cooked statement, or, as a correspondent suggests, the <span class="smcap">Cock Lane</span> ghost may
have given rise to the term. This had a great run, and was a rich harvest to the running stationers.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hotten’s Slang
Dictionary.</span></p>

<p>“Few of the residents in London&mdash;but chiefly those in the quieter streets,” says Mr. Henry Mayhew, in his exceedingly
amusing work of “London Labour and the London Poor,”&mdash;“have not been aroused, and most frequently in the evening, by a
hurly-burly on each side of the street. An attentive listening will not lead any one to an accurate knowledge of what the clamour
is about. It is from a ‘mob’ or ‘school’ of running patterers, and consists of two, three, or four men. All these men state that
the greater the noise they make, the better is the chance of sale, and better still when the noise is on each side of the street, for
it appears as if the vendors were proclaiming such interesting or important intelligence, that they were vieing with one another
who should supply the demand which must ensue. It is not possible to ascertain with any creditude <i>what</i> the patterers are so
anxious to sell, for only a few leading words are audible, as ‘Horrible,’ ‘Dreadful,’ ‘Murder,’ ‘One penny,’ ‘Love,’ ‘One penny,’
‘Mysterious,’ ‘Seduction,’ ‘Former crimes,’ ‘Nine children,’ ‘Coal-cellar,’ ‘Pool of blood,’ ‘One penny,’ and the like, can only be
caught by the ear, and there is no announcement of anything like ‘particulars.’ The running patterers describe, or profess to
describe, the contents of their papers as they go along, and they seldom or never stand still. They usually deal in murders, seductions,
crim.-cons., explosions, alarming accidents, ‘assassinations,’ deaths of public characters, duels, and love-letters. But
popular, or notorious murders are the ‘great goes.’ The running patterer cares less than any other street-sellers for bad weather,
for if he ‘work’ on a wet and gloomy evening, and if the work be ‘<span class="smcap">A COCK</span>,’&mdash;which is, a fictitious statement,&mdash;there is less
chance of anyone detecting the <i>ruse</i>. Among the old stereotyped ‘<span class="smcap">COCKS</span>’ are love-letter. One is well known as a “Married Man
caught in a Trap.” And being in a dialogue and an epistolary form, subserves any purpose: as the ‘Love-Letters,’ that have passed
between Mr. Smith, the butcher, baker, grocer, draper, &amp;c.&mdash;‘the decoyer of female innocence’&mdash;and Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Jones, or
Mrs. Robinson, or Miss A&mdash;, B&mdash;, or C&mdash;, not 100 yards off&mdash;‘And the very image of his father,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;and can be fitted to any
real or pretended local scandal.</p>

<p>When the patterer visits the country, he is accompanied by a mate, and the “copy of werses” is then announced as being
written by an “underpaid curate” within a day’s walk. “It tells mostly, sir,” said one man; “for its a blessing to us that there
always is a journeyman parson what the people knows, and what the patter fits.” Sometimes the poetry is attributed to a sister
of mercy, or to a popular poetess; very frequently, by the patterers who best understand the labouring classes, to Miss Eliza Cook.
Sometimes the verses are written by a “sympathising gent” in that parish, “but his name wasn’t to be mentioned, or any nobleman
or gentleman,” whose name is before the public in connection with any recent event, or an assumed account of “A Battle
between Two Ladies of Fortune.” The patterers have only to stick a picture in their hat to attract attention, and to make all the
noise they can.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the running patterer transmigrates into a standing one, betaking himself to “board work,” as it is termed in
street technology, and stopping at the corners of thoroughfares with a large pictorial placard raised upon a pole, and glowing with
highly-coloured exaggerations of the interesting terrors of the pamphlet he has for sale.</p>

<p>When there are no “popular murders” the standing patterer orders of the artist a new and startling “cock-board” and sells
his books or pamphlets, the titles of some of which are fully set forth and well displayed; for example: “Horrible murder and
mutilation of Lucy Game, aged 15, by her cruel brother, William Game, aged 10, of Westmill, Hertfordshire. His committal and
confession, with a copy of a letter sent to his affectionate parents.” “Full particulars of the poisonings in Essex,&mdash;the whole
family poisoned by the female servant. Confession of her guilt.&mdash;Was seduced by her master.&mdash;Revenged herself on the family.”
Another is&mdash;“Founded on facts&mdash;The Whitby Tragedy, or the Gambler’s Fate, containing the lives of Joseph Carr, aged 21, and
his sweetheart, Maria Leslie, aged 18, who were found dead, lying by each other on the morning of the 23rd of May. Maria was
on her road to town to buy some ribbon and other things for her wedding day, when her lover, in a state of intoxication, fired at
her, then run to rob his prey, but finding it was his sweetheart, reloaded his Gun, placed the Muzzle to his Mouth, and blew out
his Brains, all through the cursed Cards and Drink. With an affectionate copy of verses.”</p>

<p>A popular street-book for “board work” is entitled “Horrible Rape and Murder!!! The affecting case of Mary Ashford,
a beautiful young virgin, who was diabolically Ravished, Murdered, and thrown into a Pit, as she was returning from a Dance,
including the Trial of Abraham Thornton for the Wilful Murder of the said Mary Ashford; with the whole of the Evidence,
Charges to the Jury, &amp;c., with a Correct Plan of the Spot where the Rape and Murder were Committed.”</p>

<p>This “street-book” is founded on a fact, and, in reality, gives the salient points of a memorable circumstance which took place
in 1817, when Abraham Thornton was charged at the Warwick Assizes, before Mr. Justice Holroyd, for the murder and violation
of Mary Ashford, at Erdington, near Birmingham. The prisoner was found&mdash;after a consultation of the jury of five minutes&mdash;Not
Guilty, to the utmost surprise and disappointment of all persons assembled. The second charge of committing a rape on
the body of the said Mary Ashford was abandoned by the prosecution. The case created the greatest possible sensation at the
time, and the trial and subsequent appeal were printed and published in a separate form, and occupies 120 pages in double
columns, “with a correct plan of the spot where the rape and murder were committed, and a portrait of Thornton drawn and
engraved by G. Cruikshank.”</p>

<p>The acquittal of Thornton in the atrocious rape and murder of Mary Ashford excited the most undisguised feelings of disappointment
in all classes of persons throughout the kingdom, and various provincial newspapers began to canvass the subject
with vigour, freedom, and research. This aroused most of the London papers, and the <i>Independent Whig</i> on Sunday, August
17th after fully commenting on the case, cited several instances where individuals, who, after having been arraigned under the
charge of murder and acquitted, were tried a second time for the same offence, in consequence of an appeal by the next of kin of
the deceased against the verdict of the jury, and wound up their remarks by that,&mdash;“If ever there was a case of brutality, violation
and murder, that had greater claims upon the sympathy of the world than another, and demands a second trial, we think it
is exhibited in that of the unfortunate Mary Ashford.” This gave the “key-note,” a very large section of the press adopted the
same view of the case, and a subscription was immediately set on foot&mdash;Mary’s friends being in indigent circumstances&mdash;to defray
the necessary expenses. And Abraham Thornton was apprehended a second time, on a Writ of Appeal, for the murder of Mary
Ashford, which excited an interest in the public mind altogether unprecedented&mdash;an interest that was heightened by the unusual
recurrence of the obsolete proceedings necessary in the case by the Saxon Writ of Appeal, together with the staggering fact of
Thornton having challenged his appellant&mdash;William, the eldest brother of the deceased Mary Ashford&mdash;to a solemn trial by battle,
and avowing himself ready to defend his innocence with his body.</p>

<p>The challenge was formally given by throwing down a glove upon the floor of the Court of King’s Bench, whence the case
had been removed by “Writ of Habeas Corpus,” to be heard before Lord Ellenborough. But the combat did not take place, and
the prisoner escaped. An Act of Parliament was then passed abolishing the trial by battle in any suit, as a mode unfit to be used.</p>

<p>Mary Ashford was buried in the Churchyard of Sutton Colefield, and over her remains is placed a stone with the following
inscription, written by the Rev. Luke Booker:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse center">“As a warning to female virtue, and a humble</div>
<div class="verse center">Monument to female chastity,</div>
<div class="verse center">This stone marks the grave of</div>
<div class="verse center">MARY ASHFORD,</div>
<div class="verse center">Who, in the 20th year of her age,</div>
<div class="verse center">Having incautiously repaired to a</div>
<div class="verse center">Scene of amusement, without proper protection,</div>
<div class="verse center">Was brutally violated and murdered</div>
<div class="verse center">On the 27th of October, 1817.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The artist who paints the patterers’ boards, must address his art plainly to the eye of the spectator. He must use the most
striking colours, be profuse in the application of scarlet, light blue, orange&mdash;not yellow&mdash;that not being a good candle-light
colour&mdash;and must leave nothing to the imagination. Perspective and back-grounds are things but of minor consideration, everything
must be sacrificed for effect. These paintings are in water colours, and are rubbed over with a solution of gum-resin to protect
them from the influence of rainy weather.</p>

<p>The charge of the popular street-artist for the painting of a board is 2s. or 3s. 6d., according to the simplicity or elaborateness
of the details; the board itself is provided by the artist’s employer. The demand for this peculiar branch of street art is
very irregular, depending entirely upon whether there has or has not been perpetrated any act of atrocity, which has rivetted, as
it is called, the public attention. And so great is the uncertainty felt by the street-folk whether “the most beautiful murder will
take or not,” that it is rarely the patterer will order, or the artist will speculate, in anticipation of a demand, upon preparing the
painting of any event, until satisfied that it has become “popular.” A deed of more than usual daring, deceit, or mystery, may be
at once hailed by those connected with murder-patter as “one that will do,” and some speculation maybe ventured upon, as it
was in such cases as Greenacre, Rush, Tawell, and the Mannings, but these are merely exceptional, so uncertain, it appears, is all
that depends, without intrinsic merit, on mere popular applause.</p>

<p>It is stated that Catnach cleared over £500 by Weare’s murder and Thurtell’s trial and execution, and was so loth to leave
it, that when a wag put him up to a joke, and showed him how he might set the thing a-going again, he could not withstand it, so
about a fortnight after Thurtell had been hanged “Jemmy” brought out a startling broad-sheet, headed “WE ARE ALIVE
AGAIN!” He put so little space between the two words “we” and “are,” that it looked at first sight like “WEARE.” Many
thousands were bought by the ignorant and gullible public, but those who did not like the trick called it a “<span class="smcap">CATCHPENNY</span>,” and
this gave rise to this peculiar term, which ever afterwards stuck to the issues of the “Seven Dials Press.”</p>

<p>For the use of the first two wood cuts in our collection of “Cocks” and “Catchpennies” we are indebted to the kindness of
Messrs. Charles Griffin and Co., of Stationers’ Hall Court, the present proprietors of Mayhew’s <i>London Labour and the London Poor</i>&mdash;a
work which, of all others, gives by far the best description of <span class="smcap">London Street-Folk</span>; and is of itself a complete cyclopædia
of the condition and earnings of&mdash;those that <i>will</i> work, those that <i>cannot</i> work, and those that <i>will not</i> work. We had intended
to have used the originals of “Jemmy” Catnach, but Mr. W. S. Fortey, his successor, writes to inform us that, after a lengthened
and active service, the cuts in question were worked and worked until they fell to pieces.</p>

<p>With these remarks we now introduce our readers to a genuine Catnachian “Cock,” and one that is said to have “fought
well in its day,” entitled, “Horrid Murder Committed by a Young Man on a Young Woman.”</p>

Committed by a young Man on a young Woman.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>George Caddell became acquainted with
Miss Price and a degree of intimacy subsisted
between them, and Miss Price,
degraded as she was by the unfortunate
step she had taken, still thought herself an
equal match for one of Mr. Caddell’s rank
of life. As pregnancy was shortly the
result of their intimacy, she repeatedly
urged him to marry her, but he resisted
her importunities for a considerable time.
At length she heard of his paying his
addresses to Miss Dean, and threatened, in
case of his non-compliance, to put an end to
all his prospects with that young lady, by
discovering everything that had passed
between them. Hereupon he formed a
horrid resolution of murdering her, for he
could neither bear the thought of forfeiting
the esteem of a woman who he loved, nor of
marrying one who had been as condescending
to another as to himself. So he called on
Miss Price on a Saturday and requesting
her to walk with him in the fields on the
following day, in order to arrange a plan for
their intended marriage. Miss Price met
him at the time appointed, on the road leading
to Burton, at a house known by the
name of “The Nag’s Head.” Having accompanied
her supposed lover into the fields,
and walked about till towards evening, they
sat down under a hedge, where, after a little
conversation, Caddell suddenly pulled out a
knife and cut her throat, and made his
escape, but not before he had waited till she
was dead. In the distraction of his mind
he left behind him the knife with which he
had perpetrated the deed, and his case of
instruments. On the following morning,
Miss Price being found murdered in the field,
great numbers went to take a view of the
body, among whom was the woman of the
house where she lodged, who recollected
that she said she was going to walk with
Mr. Caddell, on which the instruments were
examined and sworn to have belonged to
him. He was accordingly taken into
custody.</p>

<img class="wordpicture" src="images/cruel-and-inhuman-murder.jpg" width="700" height="40" alt="CRUEL AND INHUMAN MURDER" />
Committed upon the body of Captain Lawson.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img008.jpg" width="500" height="273" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is with surprise we have learned that this neighbourhood
for a length of time, was amazingly alarmed
this day, by a crowd of people carrying the body of
Mr James Lawson to a doctor, while streams of blood
besmeared the way in such a manner, that cries of
murder re-echoed the sound of numerous voices. It
appears that the cause of alarm, originated through a
courtship attended with a solemn promise of marriage,
between him and Miss Lucy Gurd, a handsome young
lady of refined feelings, with the intercourse of a
superior enlightened mind, who lived with her aunt,
who spared neither pain, nor cost, to improve the
talents of Miss G. these seven years past, since the
death of her mother in Ludgate Hill, London, and
bore a most excellent character, until she got entangled
by the deluding allurements of Mr L., who after they
mutually agreed and appointed the nuptial day, not
only violated his promise, (on account of her fortune
being small,) but boasted thro’ the neighbourhood of
the unbecoming manner he had triumphed over her
virtue (which left her in a languishing situation those
six months past) while he chanted his eloquence to
another young lady, of a stamp more adequate to a
covetous mind, (namely of a great fortune) who took
such a deep impression in his heart, that he advanced
the most energetic gallantry, and obtained her consent,
got the banns published in London, and on the point
of getting married to her, with a rapturous prospect of
holding a rural wedding, yet we find that the intended
bride had learned that Miss Gurd held certain promissory
letters of his, and that she determined to enter an
action against him for a breach of promise, which
moved, clouded and eclipsed over the variable Mr
Lawson, who knew that Miss Gurd had letters of his,
sufficient to substantiate her claim in a Court of Law.
However, he was determined to remove that obstacle,
at all events, which was not likely to diminish
the only idol which the twofold miscreant so
faithfully worshipped&mdash;namely, gold and that
nothing should prevent his intended wedding, but it
appears, when he comes to traverse his imagination, that
two unexpected obstacles greatly embarrassed his
proceedings. He demanded from her his letters at the
peril of her life, which Miss G. like a distinguished
young lady, refused, and prepared herself with unequal
fortitude, and after stating to him the consequences of
his unmanly conduct she cautiously ordered him to quit
the premises, where to confirm his ambition (which
crowned his reward) he readily attempted to get near
her trunk, through which a sturdy scuffle ensued, and
while she screamed for assistance, he attempted to
commit an outrageous violation on her person, when to
protect her virtue, she drew a large carving knife, and
stabbed him under the left breast (which quickly
brought him to subjection), his vehement cries alarmed
the neighbours, who came to her assistance, and found
them both in a contest at the door, while she thrusted
him out in a gore of blood, which exhibited a scene of
such momentary confusion, that the most anxious
conjecture was unable to draw the slightest idea on the
wanton provocation, yet it appears that though the
skillful physicians succeeded in stopping the blood, that
they can form but little hopes of his recovery, as they
are doubtful as to the knife having separated an artery,
and should thus prove to be the case, they are decidedly
of opinion, that it will put a certain period to his existence,
which leaves the intended bride to bewail her disappointment,
while the valiant victress was forced to submit
to judicial decorum in the 19th year of her age, where
sufficient sponsors voluntary offered to join her recognisance,
to await the issue. The whole of her evidence
being bound to appear on her final trial (which will
gratify the curious where we expect the judge of equity
will give an electrical oration, on amorous gallantry,
passionate affection, breach of promises, &amp;c., when
Cupid’s private Ambassadors, or the precious Love
Letters will appear unmasked at Chelmsford ensuing
Assizes.&mdash;<i>Epping Telegraph.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>TRIAL.</h4>

<p>At an early hour on the morning of the trial, the court was crowded to excess, the Judge taking his seat at nine
o’clock. The Prisoner, on being placed at the bar, pleaded ‘Not Guilty’ in a firm tone of voice. The trial lasted many
hours, when, having been found ‘GUILTY,’ the learned Judge addressed the prisoner as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Prisoner, you have been found guilty of a most cold-blooded murder, a more deliberate murder I never heard of.
You and your wife had been to a neighbouring town, and were returning home, when you did it. She was found in a
ditch. I cannot hold out the slightest hope of mercy towards you in this case.” During this address the whole court
was melted into tears. His Lordship then put on the black cap and passed the sentence as usual, holding out no hope
of mercy to the prisoner.</p>

<h4>Letter written after his Condemnation.</h4>

<p class="indent4em">Dear Sister,</p>

<p>When you receive this you will see that I am condemned to die; my Father and Mother are coming to take their last

another to your family, I beg that you will refrain from coming; if that you do serious may be the consequences, therefore,
dear Sister, do not attempt to come. I hope that no one will upbraid you for what I have done; so may God bless
you and yours; farewell! dear sister for ever.</p>

<h4>EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>The Execution of the above prisoner took place early this morning at eight o’clock, the people flocking to the scene at an
early hour. As the period of the wretched man’s departure drew near, the chaplain became anxious to obtain from him a
confession of the justice of the sentence. He acknowledged the justice of his sentence, and said he was not fit to live, and that
he was afraid to die, but he prayed to the Lord for forgiveness, and hoped through the merits of his Saviour that his prayer
would be heard. Having received the sacrament, the executioner was not long in performing his office. The solemn procession
moved towards the place of execution, the chaplain repeating the confession words, “In the midst of life we are in death.”
Upon ascending the platform he appeared to tremble very much. The cap being drawn over his eyes and the signal given,
the wretched man was launched into eternity. He died almost without a struggle. After the body had hanged the usual time
it was cut down and buried according to the sentence, in the gaol.</p>

<p class="center larger">Showing how John Hedges, a farmer’s son, committed a rape upon
Jane Williams, and afterwards Murdered her and her lover, William
Edwards, in a field near Paxton.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is a most revolting Murder. It appears Jane Williams was keeping company, and was shortly to be
married to William Edwards, who was in the employment of Farmer Hodges. For some time a jealousy existed in
John Hodges, who made vile proposals to the young girl, who although of poor parents was strictly virtuous. The
girl’s father also worked on farmer Hodges’s estate. On Thursday last she was sent to the farm to obtain some
things for her mother, who was ill; it was 9 o’clock in the evening when she set out, a mile from the farm. Going
across the fields she was met by the farmer’s son, who made vile proposals to her, which she not consenting to, he threw
her down, and accomplished his vile purpose. In the meantime her lover had been to her house, and finding she was
gone to the farm, went to meet her. He found her in the field crying, and John Hodges standing over her with a
bill-hook, saying he would kill her if she ever told. No one can tell the feelings of the lover, William Edwards.
He rushed forward, when Hodges, with the hook, cut the legs clean from his body, and with it killed the poor girl,
and then run off. Her father finding she did not return, went to look for her; when the awful deeds were discovered.
Edwards was still alive, but died shortly afterwards from loss of blood, after giving his testimony to the
magistrates. The farmer’s son was apprehended, and has been examined and committed to take his trial at the next
Assizes.</p>

<p>Thousands of persons followed the unfortunate lovers to the grave, where they were buried together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A scene of bloodshed of the deepest dye has been
committed in this neighbourhood, which has caused a
painful and alarming sensation among all classes in this
place, in consequence of its being committed by an
individual that is well known to most of the inhabitants
who are going in great numbers to the fatal spot where
the unfortunate and ill-fated victim has met with this
melancholy and dreadful end.</p>

<p>On the news arriving at our office, we at once dispatched
our reporter to the spot, and on his arrival he
found the place surrounded by men, women, and
children, gathered around where the vital spark had
fled, which was never to be regained on the face of
this earth. Deep was the conversation among the
accumulated persons, as to how a fellow creature could
be guilty of committing such a revolting and diabolical
act upon one, who, it appears, was much respected in
this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The reporter states that on the police authorities
arriving at the place, they had some difficulty in preserving
order; but after a short lapse of time this was
accomplished. They then proceeded to the spot where
the lifeless corpse laid, and took possession of the same,
and which presented one of the most awful spectacles
that has been witnessed for many years.</p>

<p>What could have been the motive for such a cold-blooded
and wanton murder being committed we are at
a loss to conceive; without it was in consequence of
some disagreement having taken place between the unfortunate
victims and their assailants, and then ending
in the depriving their fellow-creatures of life, which we
are forbidden, according to the commandments, to take
away; but this seems to be entirely violated in many
instances by our dissipated and irregular habits which
tends to the committal of such serious things, and
through disobeying the scriptural advice brings the
degraded creatures to an untimely end. According to
the Scriptures, “He that sheddeth man’s blood, by man
shall his blood be shed,” which we entirely agree with
in these instances, and fully acknowledge the just sentence
that is often obliged to be carried into effect; and
certainly must say, that were it not for the rigidness of
those laws, many of us would not be able to proceed on
our journey at heart. So, therefore, we are in duty
bound to call upon those laws being fully acted up to,
for it is our opinion that those crimes are very seldom
committed without there is some disregard or ill feeling
towards their unfortunate victims, and thereby end
their days in a dreadful manner.</p>

<p>The unfortunate persons being so well known and so
much respected, every one feels anxious to know all
particulars, and it is the constant enquiry amongst them
to know if there is any one apprehended for the murder,
or if there is anything more known as to lead to the
suspicion who it has been committed by, all being very
desirous to hear of the perpetrators of this diabolical
and horrid deed. We feel much for the family, who
are thrown into the greatest affliction through this
dreadful circumstance, and which has cast a gloom over
the circle of friends in which they moved.</p>

<p>As a member of society, there will be no one that we
know of who will be more missed; one who was often
known to relieve the wants of his fellow creatures as
far as his circumstances would permit, and whose society
was courted by all. As a member, of the family to
which they belonged, none will be more deeply regretted,
but those who are now remaining will feel the
loss and deplore the lamentable death of their respected
and worthy friends.&mdash;Just as we are going to press, we
have received information from our reporter, that something
has been elicited from a party that has thrown a
light on this subject, and which has led to the apprehension
of one of the principal offenders, and who, if
proved guilty, will, we hope, meet with that punishment
due to his fearful crime.</p>

<p class="center">To the County Gaol at Oxford for the</p>

<p class="center"><span class="larger">MURDER OF HIS WIFE</span><br />
AND THREE CHILDREN,</p>

<p class="center">On the 12th instant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 185px;">
<img src="images/divider-horizontal-6.jpg" width="185" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This morning, the 12th inst., the neighbourhood
of Queen-st., Banbury, was thrown
into a state of excitement at hearing the cries
of murder between the hours of 12 and 1,
at the house of Wm. Thompson. Several of
the neighbours arose from their beds and
knocked at, and tried the door, but all was
silent, when Sarah Cope said, some efforts
must be made to enter, and two Policemen
were quickly on the spot, and about 2 o’clock
they forced the door open, when a most awful
sight presented itself. The wife lay
weltering in her blood and with her head
literally knocked to pieces, and the prisoner,
who was drunk, was quickly apprehended.
Up stairs the two youngest were found lying
in a pool of blood on the chamber floor, and
the eldest boy, Thomas, four years old, was
found a lifeless corpse on the bed, and the
clothes covered with blood.</p>

<p>Two surgeons pronounced life to be extinct.
An inquest was held at the Blue Boar, and
after a post-mortem examination of the bodies,
and the whole of the Evidence heard
by the Jury, a Verdict of Wilful Murder was
returned against William Thompson.</p>

<p>The Prisoner was calm during the whole
of the proceedings, and did not attempt to
deny his guilt. Since his committal he has
made the following Confession.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/divider-horizontal-1.jpg" width="250" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<h4>THE CONFESSION.</h4>

<p>On the 12th ultimo, I left my wife and family and
went to the house of Sarah Potts, and during the
day when we were drinking, she asked me to leave my
family and live with her; I gave her no decisive answer
at that time. At midnight I returned home and found
my wife and children were gone to bed, but she got up
and let me in without speaking an angry word; but I
got hold of an iron bar and struck her a fatal blow on
the head, and repeated the blows until she was dead.
I then proceeded to the bed-room, where the children
were. My eldest son, Thomas, four years of age, begged
for mercy, but I was deaf to his cries and tears; I then
raised the bar of iron and struck him three times on
the head; the two youngest are twins, I beat their
heads against the chamber floor, and I hope the Lord
will forgive me.</p>

<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
<span class="largest">MURDER.</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following melancholy account was given by a
very worthy man, Mr. Thomas Marshall, a Church
warden well-known and respected by all.</p>

<p>Some years ago, a young gentleman and lady came
out of Scotland, as is supposed, upon a matrimonial
affair. As they were travelling through the country,
they were robbed and murdered, at a place called the
Winnetts, near Castleton. Their bones were found
about two years ago, by some miners who were sinking
an Engine-pit at the place.</p>

<p>One James Ashton, of Castleton, who died about a
fortnight ago, and who was one of the murderers, was
most miserably afflicted and tormented in his conscience.
He had been dying, it was thought, for ten weeks; but
could not die till he had confessed the whole affair.
But when he had done this, he died immediately.</p>

<p>He said, Nicholas Cock, Thomas Hall, John Bradshaw,
Francis Butler, and himself, meeting the above
gentleman and lady in the Winnets, pulled them off
their horses, and dragged them into a barn belonging to
one of them, and took from them two hundred pounds.
Then seizing on the young gentleman, the young lady
(whom Ashton said was the fairest woman he ever saw)
entreated them, in the most piteous manner, not to kill
him, as she was the cause of his coming into that
country. But, notwithstanding all her intreaties, they
cut his throat from ear to ear! They then seized the
young lady herself, and, though she entreated them, on
her knees, to spare her life, and turn her out naked!
yet one of the wretches drove a Miner’s pick into her
head, when she dropped down dead at his feet. Having
thus dispatched them both, they left their bodies in the
barn, and went away with their booty.</p>

<p>At night they returned to the barn, in order to take
them away; but they were so terrified with a frightful
noise that they durst not move them: and so it was the
second night. But the third night, Ashton said it was
only the Devil, who would not hurt him; so they took
the bodies away and buried them.</p>

<p>They then divided the money: and as Ashton was a
coal carrier to a Smelt Mill, on the Sheffield Road, he
bought horses with his share; but they all died in a
little time. Nicholas Cock fell from a precipice, near
the place where they had committed the murder, and
was killed. Thomas Hall hanged himself. John Bradshaw
was walking near the place where they had buried
the bodies, when a stone fell from the hill and killed
him on the spot, to the astonishment of every one who
knew it. Francis Butler, attempted many times to
hang himself, but was prevented; however, he went
mad, and died in a most miserable manner.</p>

<p>Thus, though they escaped the hand of human justice
(which seldom happens in such a case), yet the Invisible
Hand found them out, even in this world. How true
then it is, that He art about our path, and about our
bed, and spiest out all our ways!</p>

<p class="center smaller">“There are but two classes of persons in the world&mdash;those who are
hanged, and those who are not hanged; and it has been my lot to belong
to the former.”</p>

<p>There are few men, perhaps, who have not a hundred
times in the course of their life, felt a curiosity to know
what their sensations would be if they were compelled
to lay life down. The very impossibility, in all
ordinary cases, of obtaining any approach to this
knowledge, is an incessant spur pressing on the fancy
in its endeavours to arrive at it. Thus poets and
painters have ever made the estate of a man condemned
to die one of their favourite themes of comment or
description. Footboys and prentices hang themselves
almost every other day, conclusively&mdash;missing their
arrangement for slipping the knot half way&mdash;out of a
seeming instinct to try the secrets of that fate, which&mdash;less
in jest than in earnest&mdash;they feel an inward
monition may become their own. And thousand of
men, in early life, are uneasy until they have mounted
a breach, or fought a duel, merely because they wish to
know, experimentally, that their nerves are capable of
carrying them through that peculiar ordeal.</p>

<p>Now <i>I</i> am in a situation to speak from experience,
upon that very interesting question&mdash;the sensations
attendant upon a passage from life to death. I have
been <span class="smcap">HANGED</span>, and am <span class="smcap">ALIVE</span>&mdash;perhaps there are no three
other men at this moment, in Europe, who can make
the same declaration.</p>

<p>Before this statement meets the public eye, I shall
have quitted England for ever; therefore I have no
advantage to gain from its publication. And, for the
vanity of knowing, when I shall be a sojourner in a
far country, that my name&mdash;for good or ill&mdash;is talked
about in this,&mdash;such fame would scarcely do even my
pride much good, when I dare not lay claim to its
identity, But the cause which excites me to write is
this&mdash;My greatest pleasure, through life, has been the
perusal of any extraordinary narratives of fact. An
account of a shipwreck in which hundreds have perished;
of a plague which has depopulated towns or
cities; anecdotes and inquiries connected with the regulations
of prisons, hospitals, or lunatic receptacles; nay,
the very police reports of a common newspaper&mdash;as
relative to matters of reality, have always excited a
degree of interest in my mind, which cannot be produced
by the best-invented tale of fiction. Because I
believe, therefore, that to persons of a temper like my
own, the reading of that which I have to relate will
afford very high gratification;&mdash;and because I know
also, that what I describe can do mischief to no one,
while it may prevent the symptoms and details of a
very rare consummation from being lost; for these
reasons I am desirous, as far as a very limited education
will permit me, to write a plain history of the strange
fortunes and miseries to which, during the last twelve
months, I have been subjected.</p>

<p>I have stated already, that I have <i>been</i> hanged and
<i>am</i> alive. I can gain nothing now by misrepresentation&mdash;I
was <span class="smcap">GUILTY</span> of the act for which I suffered. There
are individuals of respectability whom my conduct
already has disgraced, and I will not revive their shame
and grief by publishing my name. But it stands in the
list of capital convictions in the Old Bailey Calendar for
the Winter Sessions of 18&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Showing how a Father and Mother barbarously Murdered their own Son.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img017.jpg" width="450" height="364" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A few days ago a sea-faring man, who had just
returned to England after an absence of thirty years in
the East Indies, called at a lodging-house, in Liverpool,
for sailors, and asked for supper and a bed; the landlord
and landlady were elderly people, and apparently poor.
The young man entered into conversation with them,
invited them to partake of his cheer, asked many
questions about themselves and their family, and
particularly of a son who had gone to sea when a boy,
and whom they had long given over as dead. At night
the landlady shewed him to his room, and when she
was leaving him he put a large purse of gold into her
hand, and desired her to take care of it till the morning,
pressed her affectionately by the hand, and bade her
good night. She returned to her husband and shewed
him the accursed gold: for its sake they mutually
agreed to murder the traveller in his sleep.</p>

<p>In the dead of the night, when all was still, the old
couple silently creaped into the bed room of their
sleeping guest, all was quiet: the landlady approached
the bedside, and then cut his throat, severed his head
from his body; the old man, upwards of seventy years
of age, holding the candle. They put a washing-tub
under the bed to catch his blood. And then ransacking
the boxes of the murdered man they found more gold,
and many handsome and costly articles, the produce of
the East Indies, together, with what proved afterwards,
to be a marriage certificate.</p>

<p>In the morning, early, came a handsome and elegantly
dressed lady and asked, in a joyous tone, for the traveller
who had arrived the night before. The old people
seemed greatly confused, but said he had risen early and
gone away. “Impossible!” said the lady, and bid them
go to his bed-room and seek him, adding, “you will be
sure to know him as he has a mole on his left arm in
the shape of a strawberry. Besides, ’tis your long lost
son who has just returned from the East Indies, and I
am his wife, and the daughter of a rich planter long
settled and very wealthy. Your son has come to make
you both happy in the evening of your days, and he
resolved to lodge with you one night as a stranger, that
he might see you unknown, and judge of your conduct
to wayfaring mariners.”</p>

<p>The old couple went up stairs to examine the corpse,
and they found the strawberry mark on its arm, and
they then knew that they had murdered their own son,
they were seized with horror, and each taking a loaded
pistol blew out each other’s brains.</p>

OF THE SEA HORSE,<br />
<span class="smaller">On her Homeward Passage from Sydney, and the Plunder of 18,000 ounces of Gold by the Murderers.</span></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have just received intelligence of one of the most
daring cases of plunder and wholesale murder on the
high seas that it is our duty to make public for many
years. It appears that the crew and thirteen passengers
of the ill-fated ship, the Sea Horse, some of whom had
been seeking to better their condition by toiling at the
diggings of Ballarat, Bendigo, and the several numerous
diggings of the surrounding country, whilst others had
gained a respectable position in life by mercantile and
other pursuits, all returning light-hearted and elated by
their good success to the land of their birth, and to look
on the dear faces, and gladden the hearts of the dear
ones they had left at home, but whom they were doomed
never to meet no more on earth. Among the crew was
a Spaniard known by the name of Digo Salvesata, and
three others, who were tempted by a love of gold to
gain possession of the valuable cargo, to do which, they
conceived the horrid idea of putting the whole of the
passengers and that part of the crew who would not
join them to death. The following are the facts of this
demon-like outrage:&mdash;It appears that the Sarah Ann, of
North Shields, on her passage home, was driven by the
gales into the German ocean, and it was in sight of the
white cliffs of Old England that these horrible murders
were committed. As the Sarah Ann was laying at
anchor on the morning of the 12th, at day break they
saw through the fog the ill-fated vessel, and not seeing
any one on deck they hailed her, and on receiving no
answer a boat was immediately lowered, and they went
on board, and on getting below a shocking sight met
their gaze, with one exception the whole of the passengers
and the remainder of the crew were in their berths
stiff and cold, with their throats cut, and otherwise
dreadfully disfigured. One poor man had a piece of
dirty sheet tied tightly round his throat, and about
eight inches of it stuffed tightly into his mouth. On
this being removed, there was a large wound in the
throat four inches in extent from right to left; there
were five incisors on the right side ending in one deep
one on the left. The windpipe was cut through and
the muscles of the neck on the left side; the forehead
was contused and scratched. The hair was covered
with blood. On the back part of the right hand there
were several scratches. Most of the victims were more
or less mutilated. On going to the Captain’s cabin
another shocking sight presented itself, he was laying
completely hacked to pieces, his tongue was completely
cut out at the root, and his entrails strewed on the cabin
floor, showing that there had been a terrible struggle;
it appears from the statement of a man who had stowed
in the hold to escape the slaughter, that the second
mate, who is one of the murderers, treated the passengers
and the rest of the crew with some grog in which
some laudnum was mixed, which rendered them senseless,
and while in that helpless state murdered them in
the manner described, they afterwards went to the
Captain’s cabin, who fought bravely but was overpowered
by numbers, they then took all the gold they
could find and lowered the long boat and made off with
their ill-gotten gains. The tiller of the boat has been
found, so whether they have escaped and sent the boat
adrift is not known, but search is being made after the
murderers, and we hope they will soon be taken, and
meet with their just reward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[Few public calamities recorded in our annals can
bear a comparison, in point of distress, with the tremendous
conflagration which reduced the greater part
of the British metropolis to ashes, in the 1666. Of
this dire catastrophe, all our histories give a general,
and some of them a detailed, account; but no relation
hitherto published is so minutely descriptive as that
written at the time, and as it were on the smoking
embers of the city, by the ingenious John Evelyn;
from whose memoirs we have therefore extracted the
whole narration.]</p>

<p>September 2. This fatal night about ten began that
deplorable fire near Fish Street, in London.</p>

<p>Sept. 3. The fire continuing, after dinner I took
coach, with my wife and son, and went to the bank
side in Southwark, where we beheld that dismal spectacle,
the whole city in dreadful flames near the waterside;
all the houses from the bridge, all Thames street,
and upwards towards Cheapside down to the Three
Cranes, were now consumed.</p>

<p>The fire having continued all this night (if I may
call that night which was light as day for ten miles
round about, after a dreadful manner), when conspiring
with a fierce eastern wind in a very dry season; I went
on foot to the same place, and saw the whole south
part of the city burning from Cheapside to the Thames,
and all along Cornhill (for it kindled back against the
wind as well as forward) Tower street, Fenchurch street,
Gracious street, and so along to Bainard’s Castle, and
was now taking hold of St. Paul’s Church, to which the
scaffolds contributed exceedingly. The conflagration
was so universal, and the people so astonished, that from
the beginning, I know not by what despondency or fate,
they hardly stirred to quench it, so that there was
nothing heard or seen but crying out and lamentation,
running about like distracted creatures, without attempting
to save even their goods, such a strange consternation
there was upon them, so as it burned both in breadth
and length, the Churches, Public Halls, Exchange,
Hospitals, Monuments, and ornaments, leaping after a
prodigious manner from house to house and street to
street, at great distances one from the other, for the heat
with a long set of fair and warm weather had even
ignited the air and prepared the materials to receive the
fire, which devoured after a most incredible manner,
houses, furniture, and every thing. Here we saw the
Thames covered with goods floating, all the barges and
boats laden with what some had time and courage to
save, as, on the other, the carts, &amp;c., carrying out to
the fields, which for many miles were strewed with
moveables of all sorts, and tents erecting to shelter both
people and what goods they could get away. Oh the
miserable and calamitous spectacle! such as haply the
world had not seen the like since the foundation of it,
nor to be outdone till the universal conflagration. All
the sky was of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning
oven, the light seen above forty miles round about for
many nights. God grant my eyes may never behold the
like, now seeing above ten thousand houses all in one
flame; the noise and cracking and thunder of the
impetuous flames, the shrieking of women and children,
the hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses, and
churches, was like a hideous storm, and the air all about
so hot and inflamed that at last one was not able to
approach it, so that they were forced to stand still and
let the flames burn on, which they did for near two
miles in length and one in breadth. The clouds of
smoke were dismal and reached upon computation near
fifty miles in length. Thus I left it this afternoon
burning, a resemblance of Sodom, or the last day&mdash;London
was, but is no more!</p>

<h3><a name="THUNDERSTORM" id="THUNDERSTORM"></a>AN ACCOUNT<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE</span><br />
<span class="larger">FATAL THUNDERSTORM,</span></h3>

<p class="center">Which happened in these parts, and the<br />
<span class="larger">SINGULAR DREAM OF A YOUNG MAN,</span><br />
Well known in this Neighbourhood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the first day of this month there was a dreadful
storm of thunder and lightning in these parts. Its
most fatal effects occurred about three miles from this
town. There was a young shepherd, about twenty-three
years of age, who had always entertained a remarkable
dread of such storms; on that day, as it began
to grow cloudy, his mother would have dissuaded him
from going out, but he said he must go, as certain of his
sheep absolutely required his attendance. This was
agreeable to a tenderness of temper which, from his
childhood, had been remarkable in his character.
Quickly after he got into the fields, the storm arose; he
was then in an open valley of greensward, and upon the
neighbouring land there were two places of shelter
equally distant; the one a stack of beans where some
men were employed in thrashing, the other a rick of hay
where nobody was. Humanly speaking, his life depended
upon the choice he made between these two
places, and he unhappily chose the rick. Quickly after,
the thrashers at a small distance saw it take fire! They
immediately ran to extinguish it, which they did without
any great difficulty, as stacked hay burns but slowly;
but they found the shepherd dead! His heels were
stuck up, and his back rested against a part of the rick
which had not been on fire. On a more careful
examination, they found that his coat was singed on the
right shoulder; his waistcoat did not appear to be
burnt; but his shirt was reduced to tinder, not only on
the shoulder, but all over the back. The skin under it
appeared a little blistered, but the flesh not at all torn.
His right leg was blistered round the outer ankle, and
his shoe-buckle shattered almost to perfect powder.
There was no wound on any part of the body which
could be thought the cause of his death. About a
month before this accident he told his mother a dream
which struck deeply upon his imagination for a considerable
time. He said he fancied himself surprised
by a storm of thunder, and that he fled for shelter to
the wall of a house, when a great flash of lightning
came directly upon him, and that immediately he fancied
himself strangled for want of breath.</p>

<p>About three months previous to this melancholy
occurrence the same young man, who is well known in
these parts, and whose name and address we withhold
out of respect to his surviving relations, dreamt that
as he sat on a fragment of St. John’s Castle, romantically
situated on the shores of Loch-Ree&mdash;one of
those many ruins that are to be found in desolated parts
of this county! The scene around him was one of age
and sublimity: he felt its imposing effect and was filled
with the solemnity of its aspect! The winds were
sweeping their sullen murmurs through the broken
walls of the gigantic pile; the “voice of Time-disporting
towers” fell with a sad sound upon the ear, and he
could fancy, in the pauses of the hollow blast, that he
saw spectral shapes of other days peeping from the dark
passages and broken windows, and then suddenly disappearing
like night-birds, that, having wakened too
early for their dusky evening flight, shrink back aghast
to their gloomy bowers, from the offensive glare of a
lingering sunset! Melancholy and romance were in the
hour, and he insensibly yielded to their powerful influence.</p>

<p>As his half-closed eyes were carelessly fixed upon a
little chasm in the vaulted floor, that lay some fifty feet
beneath him, he perceived, with a surprise not unmixed
with terror, that the long grass which partly concealed
it began to move with more than the wind-motion. He
thought a thin blue smoke issued from the widening
aperture, and a confused murmer of hollow voices arose.
He would have fled from the place, but his companions
had, at his own request, left him to indulge in melancholy,
and had taken his boat for a short sail to some
islands farther up the lake; besides, he had no means
of quitting the almost insulated ruin, but by passing the
mysterious vapour, which crossed the only path to a
strip of land that connected the basement of the castle
with the main shore. This he was determined not to
do. He therefore quietly remained in the watch-tower
with mingled feelings of curiosity and dread!</p>

<p>The blue mist at length disappeared&mdash;the murmur of
hollow voices died away&mdash;all was silent again save the
beach-wave and the moaning of the wind through the
caverns of the ruin. He began to think he had
imagined the scene, and was just about to quit his hiding-place,
when suddenly the vapour issued again, and,
thunder-struck with astonishment and admiration, he
beheld a female figure slowly rising from the vault like
a spirit from earth’s tomb on its way to immortal blessedness!
she was lightly clad&mdash;lightly enough to betray
a form of beauty, half-woman, half-child, that he had
never before contemplated, even in his dreams! It was
loveliness even beyond his ideal conceptions, and seemed
to be of that age when childhood usually gives her last
portion of innocence to youth, and fearfully resigns her
little charge to approaching maturity.</p>

<p>She ascended, with the rapidity of a winged creature,
up a curtain-wall that shut out the northern view of the
lake from the interior of the castle, when, having gazed
long and wistfully (as he thought) upon the dim sail of
his little bark in the hazy distance, she descended with
the same careless activity, to a mound of ivy and wild
flowers that sprung up spontaneously in the ruin, like
sweet, but unbidden recollections of happy days gone
by in a broken heart.</p>

<div class="verse">I could have wedded a worthy farmer,</div>

<div class="verse">One day he privately did go,</div>

<div class="verse">And privately he dug a grave</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Underneath an oaken tree.</div>

<div class="verse">Of his unkindness did complain;</div>
<div class="verse indent4">At length the grave she did espy,</div>

<div class="verse">More she’d have said, but with his sword,</div>

<div class="verse">Then threw her in the silent grave,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Saying, now, there is an end of you.</div>
<div class="verse">He fill’d the grave up close again,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">With weeds the same did overspread;</div>
<div class="verse">Then unconcerned, he straight went home,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Immediately went to his bed.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Her parents dear did grieve full sore, at</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Many wonder’d at the same,</div>

<div class="verse">The thing it blazed the country round,</div>

<div class="verse">Come all fair maids both far and near and listen unto me,</div>
<div class="verse">While unto you I do relate a dreadful Tragedy,</div>
<div class="verse">A deed of blood I will unfold which lately came to light,</div>
<div class="verse">When ’tis made known, you’ll surely own you never heard the like.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">’Tis of an honest farmer’s child, a damsel fair and young,</div>
<div class="verse">Who was in tender years beguil’d all by a flattering tongue,</div>
<div class="verse">The finest lady in the land could not with her compare,</div>
<div class="verse">Her dimpled cheeks and rosy looks how charming sweet they were.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Crowds of admirers flocking came, to gain fair Susan’s love;</div>
<div class="verse">But none her favour could obtain, nor her affections move,</div>
<div class="verse">Till by mischance a youth she met, as fate would have it so,</div>
<div class="verse">Who caught her heart in Cupid’s net and prov’d her overthrow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A naval Captain of renown, beguil’d her tender youth,</div>
<div class="verse">Deceit and lies he did disguise with air of seeming truth,</div>
<div class="verse">He prais’d her looks, her shape, her air, vow’d she should be his wife,</div>
<div class="verse">And thus did vilely her ensnare&mdash;then took her precious life.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When he had thus her ruin prov’d by many a solemn vow,</div>
<div class="verse">The very maid he vow’d to love was hateful in his view.</div>
<div class="verse">With bitter tears she did implore that he’d his vows fulfil;</div>
<div class="verse">But all in vain&mdash;she charm’d no more now he had had his will.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She wrote a letter which she thought would grieve his heart full sore,</div>
<div class="verse">And tenderly she him besought, to mind the vows he swore,</div>
<div class="verse">T’was you that did my heart trepan, which now in tears I rue&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Slighted many an honest man all for the love of you.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I wish that my young babe was born and on the nurse’s knee,</div>
<div class="verse">And I myself was dead and gone and the grass grown over me.</div>
<div class="verse">When he this letter through had read, which expos’d his villainy,</div>
<div class="verse">A deadly thought came in his head her butcher for to be.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With seeming kindness in his face which made poor Susan gay,</div>
<div class="verse">He did appoint a lonely place to meet with her next day.</div>
<div class="verse">The hour arriv’d, she hasten’d there to the appointment true,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the deceitful murderer the lovely damsel slew.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When she beheld his deadly knife she rais’d her lovely face,</div>
<div class="verse">Crying, Oh! spare, Oh! spare my life and leave me to disgrace,</div>
<div class="verse">Have pity on your unborn babe tho’ you have none for me;</div>
<div class="verse">Alas! a dark untimely grave, my bridal bed will be.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Her lovely face, her beauteous eyes, for mercy plead in vain,</div>
<div class="verse">Of no avail were tears or cries unmov’d he did remain,</div>
<div class="verse">He rais’d his arm,&mdash;a deadly plunge, and down she weltering lay,</div>
<div class="verse">And while her heart’s-blood stain’d the ground, with dying breath did say.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Monster, the fearful crime you’ve done heaven’s <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will bring to light,</div>
<div class="verse">“No human eye is looking on&mdash;none sees the cruel sight.</div>
<div class="verse">“Yet righteous <span class="smcap">King</span> of heaven and earth my blood doth cry to thee,</div>
<div class="verse">“To visit my untimely death that all mankind may see.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now when this deed of blood was done he dug a hole so deep,</div>
<div class="verse">And thrust her murdered body in, then homeward did retreat,</div>
<div class="verse">But vengeance did his crime requite for to his great dismay,</div>
<div class="verse">The horrid murder came to light all in a wond’rous way.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He did confess&mdash;they dug the ground while hundreds came to view.</div>
<div class="verse">And here the murder’d corpse they found, of her who lov’d so true,</div>
<div class="verse">In irons now in Prison strong lamenting he does lie;</div>
<div class="verse">And, by the laws condemn’d ere long, most justly he will die.</div>

<p style="clear: both;">A few nights since, at a fashionable <i>hell</i> in the
western part of this <i>well policed</i> metropolis, the following
extraordinary wager was laid and decided. Lord
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; bet £5000 with the eldest son of the Duke
of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; who had frequently distinguished himself
by his eccentricities, that he would carry him on his
shoulders nine times round St. James’s square after the
business of the house was finished. At three o’clock
in the morning, the parties, attended by their friends,
repaired to the spot; but here Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- observed
that his bet was to carry his opponent, but <i>not his
clothes also</i>. However, the young hero of joking and
smoking celebrity, was not to be done by his cunning
adversary, and he actually, at that hour of the morning,
with the wind sharp as a “serpent’s tooth,” stripped
himself to the <i>buff</i>. Yes, gentle, refined, or rheumatic
reader! he, this son of the Duke of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, divesting
himself of shame (if ever he had any), stripped
himself of <i>all</i>, even to the most minute parts of his
dress, and won £5000. And then covering himself,
not with glory, but his clothes, went to finish at a
bagnio, with the notorious and accommodating Miss
C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Square, not a hundred miles
off.&mdash;<b>“These are the Men of Fashion!!”</b></p>

<div class="verse">The love and tenderness I have hitherto expressed to</div>

<p>“Yes, my dear, shall we name the day for our marriage?”</p>

<p>“Suppose we say, my love, the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Agreed; until that, adieu.”</p>

<p>On the morning appointed for the wedding, the young

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest Fanny.</span>&mdash;I have thought on your

drowned his senses in wine, and then returned home;
undressing himself, the letter fell from his bosom, his

<p>“Why have you left me, and deprived me of those
pleasures of beholding the most charming face that
nature ever made? How shall I find words to express
the passion you have inspired me with? Since the day
I first beheld your form I have felt the sharpest pangs
of love, which have worked me up to the utmost pitch
of distraction. But, alas! such a shock I felt as is impossible
to express. The dearest object of my heart is
locked in the embrace of Robert E&mdash;&mdash; that vile monster
and decoyer of female innocence. Oh! never
should I have thought that after so many pleasant hours
we have passed together, and promises pledged on either
side, that you would have slighted me in the manner
you have, and find your heart callous to one who
adores you, and even the ground your angelic form
walks upon. Oh, my adorable angel, do not forsake
me and the welfare of yourself; drop all connection
with that vile deceiver, R. E., and once more reinstate
me to that pleasure which none but lovers know. My
fluctuation of fortune shall never abate my attachment,
and I hope the day is not far distant, when I shall lead
you to the altar of Hymen. Oh! soon may the time
arrive when I may call thee, dearest Mary, my own.
Oh! my dearest angel, consent to my request, and keep
me no longer in suspense; nothing on my part shall
ever be wanting to make you happy and comfortable.
My engagement will expire in two months from hence,
when I intend to open a shop in the small-ware line,
and your abilities as a seamstress and self-adjusting
crinoline maker, with the assistance of a few work girls,
shall be able to realize an independence; and, moreover,
I will indulge you in all things needful in the
marriage state, and show my regard for you by cleaning
your shoes, lighting the fire every morning, buying
crumpets, new butter, and so forth; besides, my dear
Mary, we will live merrily upon beef-steak, oysters, and
other tasty articles necessary for our conjugal happiness,
and upon my bended kness I pray for it, and may
earthly friendship and confidence, with truest love, continue
to the end.</p>

<p class="hanging">PART I.&mdash;Showing how a noble Knight was riding by a farmer’s house, when his wife was in travail. The Knight knowing the signs and planets,
and looking on a book, read that the farmer’s daughter that was born that hour was to be his lady and bride. And how the cruel Knight got the
child from her parents, and flung it into a river; but by good fortune, the child was taken up by a poor fisherman alive, and brought home
till she was eleven years old.</p>

<p class="hanging">PART II.&mdash;How the fisherman was at an inn with some gentlemen, the cruel Knight being in the same company, and seeing the young girl come
in, he asked the fisherman if she was his own daughter, who told the story of his taking her up, &amp;c. How the cruel Knight got this poor girl
away, and contrived her death a second time, and how he was prevented.</p>

<p class="hanging">PART III.&mdash;How the Knight contrived her death a third time; but her life was saved, by showing the Knight a ring that he flung in the sea;
when the Knight saw it, found it in vain to strive against his fortune, so he married her, and made her his lady; with other things worthy of note.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>PART I.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In York fair city a farmer did dwell,</div>
<div class="verse">Who was belov’d by his neighbours full well;</div>
<div class="verse">He had a good wife who was virtuous and fair,</div>
<div class="verse">And by her he had a child every year.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In seven years time six children they had,</div>
<div class="verse">Which made both the father and mother’s heart glad</div>
<div class="verse">But a little time after as we do hear say,</div>
<div class="verse">This farmer in money and stock did decay,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Although at one time he had riches in store,</div>
<div class="verse">But a little time after he quickly grew poor.</div>
<div class="verse">He strove all he could, but alas! could not thrive,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor hardly could keep his poor children alive.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But children came faster than silver or gold,</div>
<div class="verse">For his wife she conceived again as I’m told,</div>
<div class="verse">And when her time came in hard travail she fell,</div>
<div class="verse">But if you will mind, a strange wonder I’ll tell;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A rich noble knight did chance to ride by,</div>
<div class="verse">And hearing this woman to shriek and to cry,</div>
<div class="verse">He being well learned in planets and signs,</div>
<div class="verse">Did look on a book which much puzzled his mind.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For the more he did look, still the more he did read,</div>
<div class="verse">And found that fate this young child had decreed,</div>
<div class="verse">Who was born in that house that same hour and tide</div>
<div class="verse">Had found it was she that must be his sweet bride.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But judge how the knight was disturbed in mind,</div>
<div class="verse">When he in that book his own fortune did find;</div>
<div class="verse">He quickly rode home, but was sorely oppressed,</div>
<div class="verse">From that very moment he could not have rest.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">All night he did tumble and toss in his bed,</div>
<div class="verse">And very strange projects did run in his head:</div>
<div class="verse">Then he was resolved very quickly indeed,</div>
<div class="verse">To alter that fortune he found was decreed.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With murdering heart the next morning he rose,</div>
<div class="verse">And to the house of the farmer he goes:</div>
<div class="verse">Then asked the man with a heart full of spite,</div>
<div class="verse">If the child was alive that was born last night.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Worthy sir, said the farmer, although I am poor,</div>
<div class="verse">I had one born last night, and six long before;</div>
<div class="verse">Four sons and three daughters I now have alive,</div>
<div class="verse">Which are all in good health and likely to thrive.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The Knight then replied if that seven you have,</div>
<div class="verse">Let me have the youngest, I’ll keep her most brave,</div>
<div class="verse">For you very well with one daughter can spare,</div>
<div class="verse">Which if you will grant, I will make her my heir.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For I am a Knight of noble degree,</div>
<div class="verse">And if you will part with your child unto me,</div>
<div class="verse">Full three hundred pounds unto you I will give,</div>
<div class="verse">When I from your hand your daughter receive.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The father and mother with tears in their eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Did hear this fine proffer, and were in surprise,</div>
<div class="verse">And seeing the Knight was so gallant and gay,</div>
<div class="verse">Presented the infant unto him that day.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But they spoke to him with words most mild,</div>
<div class="verse">We beseech you, kind sir, be good to our child;</div>
<div class="verse">You need not fear it, the Knight he did say,</div>
<div class="verse">For I will maintain her most gallant and gay.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then with this sweet baby away he did ride</div>
<div class="verse">Until that he came to a broad river side,</div>
<div class="verse">With cruelty bent, he resolved indeed,</div>
<div class="verse">To drown the young infant that moment with speed.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Says he if you live you must needs be my wife,</div>
<div class="verse">But I am resolved to bereave you of live:</div>
<div class="verse">For ’till you are dead I no other can have,</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore you shall lie in a watery grave.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In speaking these words, that moment, they say,</div>
<div class="verse">He flung the sweet babe in the river straightway;</div>
<div class="verse">And being well pleased when this he had done,</div>
<div class="verse">Did leap on his horse and quickly ride home.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But mind how good fortune did for her provide,</div>
<div class="verse">For the child was drove safe on her back by the tide,</div>
<div class="verse">There was a man fishing, as fortune would have,</div>
<div class="verse">Who saw the child floating upon the salt wave.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He soon took her up, but he was in amaze,</div>
<div class="verse">He kissed her, and blessed her, and on her did gaze,</div>
<div class="verse">And seeing he ne’er had a child in his life,</div>
<div class="verse">He presently carried her home to his wife.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">His wife she was pleased the child for to see,</div>
<div class="verse">And said, my dear husband, be ruled by me;</div>
<div class="verse">Since we have no child, if you let me alone,</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll keep this sweet baby, and call it our own.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The good man consented, as I have been told,</div>
<div class="verse">And spared nothing&mdash;neither silver nor gold;</div>
<div class="verse">Until she was aged eleven full years,</div>
<div class="verse">And then her sweet beauty began to appear.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h4>PART II.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">The fisherman was one time at an inn,</div>
<div class="verse">And several gentlemen drinking with him,</div>
<div class="verse">The wife sent this girl to call her man home.</div>
<div class="verse">But when she did into the drinking room come,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The gentlemen all were amazed to see</div>
<div class="verse">The fisherman’s daugter so full of beauty,</div>
<div class="verse">They presently ask’d him if she was his own,</div>
<div class="verse">So he told the whole story before he went home:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">As I was a fishing within my own bound,</div>
<div class="verse">One Monday morn this sweet baby I found;</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis a eleven years past since her life I did save,</div>
<div class="verse">Or she would have found then a watery grave.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The cruel Knight was in this company,</div>
<div class="verse">And hearing the fisherman telling his story,</div>
<div class="verse">Was vexed at his heart for to see her alive,</div>
<div class="verse">And how to destroy her again did contrive;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then spoke to the good man, and to him he said,</div>
<div class="verse">If that you will part with this pretty young maid,</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll give you whatever your heart can devise,</div>
<div class="verse">For she, in good time, to great riches will rise.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The fisherman answered with modest grace,</div>
<div class="verse">I cannot unless my dear wife is in place;</div>
<div class="verse">Get first her consent&mdash;you shall have her for me,</div>
<div class="verse">And then to go with you, dear sir, she is free.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He got his wife’s leave, and the girl with him went,</div>
<div class="verse">But little they thought of his cruel intent:</div>
<div class="verse">He kept her a month, very bravely, they say,</div>
<div class="verse">And then he contrived to make her away.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For he had a brother in fair Lancashire,</div>
<div class="verse">A noble rich man, worth two thousand a year;</div>
<div class="verse">He sent this young girl unto him with speed,</div>
<div class="verse">In hopes he would act a most barbarous deed.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He sent a man with her, likewise they did say,</div>
<div class="verse">But as they did lodge at an inn by the way,</div>
<div class="verse">A thief in the house with an evil intent,</div>
<div class="verse">To rob the portmanteau immediately went.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But the thief was amazed, when he could not find,</div>
<div class="verse">Clothes, gold or silver, or ought to his mind;</div>
<div class="verse">But only a letter, the which he did read,</div>
<div class="verse">And then put an end to this desperate deed.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The cruel Knight wrote to his brother that day,</div>
<div class="verse">To take this young innocent girl’s life away</div>
<div class="verse">With sword or with poison, that very same night,</div>
<div class="verse">And not let her live till the next morning light.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When the thief read the letter, he had the grace,</div>
<div class="verse">As to tear it, and write in the very same place:&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Dear brother, receive this young maiden from me,</div>
<div class="verse">And bring her up well as a lady should be.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Let her be esteemed, dear brother, I pray.</div>
<div class="verse">Let servants attend her by night and by day,</div>
<div class="verse">For she is a lady of noble great worth,</div>
<div class="verse">A more noble lady ne’er lived in the north.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Let her have good learning, dear brother, I pray,</div>
<div class="verse">And you for the same I’ll sufficiently pay;</div>
<div class="verse">So loving brother, my letter I end,</div>
<div class="verse">Subscribing myself your dear brother and friend.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The maid and the servant were both innocent,</div>
<div class="verse">And onward next morning their journey they went,</div>
<div class="verse">Before the sun set, to the Knight they did come,</div>
<div class="verse">When the servant did leave her, and turned home,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The girl was attended most bravely indeed,</div>
<div class="verse">With men and with maidens to serve her at need,</div>
<div class="verse">Where she did continue a whole twelve-month’s space,</div>
<div class="verse">Till this cruel Knight came to the place.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">As he and his brother together did talk,</div>
<div class="verse">He spied the fair maid in the garden to walk,</div>
<div class="verse">She looked most beautiful, pleasant and gay,</div>
<div class="verse">Like to fair Aurora, the goddess of May.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He was in a passion when her he did spy,</div>
<div class="verse">And said very angrily, Brother, O why,</div>
<div class="verse">Pray did you not do as in the letter I wrote?</div>
<div class="verse">His brother replied, It is done every whit.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">No, no, said the Knight, it is not I see,</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore she shall back again go with me;</div>
<div class="verse">But his brother did show him the letter that day,</div>

<div class="verse">Then from his own finger a ring he did take</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And unto this maiden in anger did say.</div>
<div class="verse">This ring to the water I’ll now throw away;</div>
<div class="verse">Pray look on it well, the poesy is plain,</div>
<div class="verse">And when you see it you may know it again.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I charge you for life, ne’er come more in my sight,</div>
<div class="verse">For if you do, I shall owe you a spite;</div>
<div class="verse">Unless that you bring the same ring unto me,</div>
<div class="verse">With that he let the ring drop into the sea.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Which when he had done, from the maid he did go</div>
<div class="verse">And left her to wander in sorrow and woe;</div>
<div class="verse">She rambled all night, and at last did espy,</div>
<div class="verse">A homely poor cottage, and to it did hie.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Being hungry and cold, with a heart full of grief,</div>
<div class="verse">She went to the cottage, and asked for relief.</div>
<div class="verse">The people relieved her, and the very next day,</div>
<div class="verse">They got her a service, as I hear people say,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">At a nobleman’s house, not far from that place,</div>
<div class="verse">Where she behaved herself with modest grace;</div>
<div class="verse">She was a cook maid, and forgot all things past,</div>
<div class="verse">But here is a wonder, now comes at the last.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When she a fish dinner was dressing one day,</div>
<div class="verse">And opening the head of a Cod, as they say,</div>
<div class="verse">She found a rich ring, and was struck in amaze,</div>
<div class="verse">And then she with wonder upon it did gaze.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">At viewing it well she found it to be</div>
<div class="verse">The very same ring the Knight threw in the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">She smiled when she saw it, and blest her kind fate,</div>
<div class="verse">But she did to no creature the secret relate.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The maid in her place did all others excel,</div>
<div class="verse">That the lady took notice, and liked her so well;</div>
<div class="verse">Said she was born of a noble degree,</div>
<div class="verse">And took her, her own fair companion to be.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The hard-hearted Knight unto this place he came,</div>
<div class="verse">A little time after, with persons of fame,</div>
<div class="verse">But was struck to the heart when he there did behold</div>
<div class="verse">This charming young virgin in trappings of gold.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then he asked the lady to grant him a boon,</div>
<div class="verse">And said ’twas to talk with that virgin alone;</div>
<div class="verse">The lady consented, and the young maid,</div>
<div class="verse">Who quickly agreed, but was sorely afraid.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When he did meet her, you strumpet, said he,</div>
<div class="verse">Pray did not I charge you to never meet me;</div>
<div class="verse">This hour is your last, to the world bid good night,</div>
<div class="verse">For being so bold as to appear in my sight.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Said she, in the sea, sir, you flung your own ring,</div>
<div class="verse">And bid me not see you, unless I could bring</div>
<div class="verse">That ring unto you, and I have it, said she,</div>
<div class="verse">Behold, ’tis the same that was thrown in the sea.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When the Knight saw the ring he did fly to her arms</div>
<div class="verse">He kissed her and swore she’d a million of charms,</div>
<div class="verse">Said he, charming creature, I pray pardon me,</div>
<div class="verse">Who so often contrived the ruin of thee.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">’Tis in vain for to alter what fate does decree,</div>
<div class="verse">For I find thou wast born my dear bride to be;</div>
<div class="verse">Then married they were, as I hear people say,</div>
<div class="verse">And now she’s a lady both gallant and gay.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then quickly he to her parents did haste,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the Knight told the story of all that was past,</div>
<div class="verse">But asked both their pardons upon his bare knee,</div>
<div class="verse">Which they gave, and rejoiced their daughter to see.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Then he for the fisherman and his wife sent,</div>
<div class="verse">And for their past trouble did give them content,</div>
<div class="verse">But there was great joy by all those that did see,</div>
<div class="verse">The farmer’s young daughter a lady to be.</div>

<p>““Will you remember me, Jane?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Will you keep your hand for me for a year?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Will you answer me when I write to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“One request more&mdash;O Jane, reflect that my life depends
upon your acquiescence&mdash;should I succeed, will
you marry me, in spite of your uncle?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” answered Jane.</p>

<p>There was no pause&mdash;reply followed question, as if it
were a dialogue which they had got by heart&mdash;and by
heart indeed they had got it; but I leave you to guess
the book they had conned it from.</p>

<p>’Twas in a green lane, on a summer’s evening, about
nine o’clock, when the west, like a gate of gold, had shut
upon the retiring sun, that Jane and her lover, hand in
hand, walked up and down. His arm was the girdle of
her waist; hers formed a collar for his neck, which a
knight of the garter&mdash;aye, the owner of the sword that
dubbed him&mdash;might well have been proud to wear.
Their gait was slow, and face was turned to face; near
were their lips while they spoke; and much of what
they said never came to the ear, though their souls
caught up every word of it.</p>

<p>Jane was upwards of five years the junior of her lover.
She had known him since she was a girl in her twelfth
year. He was almost eighteen then; and, when she
thought far more about a doll than a husband, he would
set her upon his knee, and call her his little wife. One,
two, three years passed on, and still, whenever he came
from college, and as usual went to pay his first visit at
her father’s, before he had been five minutes in the
parlour, the door was flung open, and in bounded Jane,
and claimed her accustomed seat. The fact was, till she
was fifteen, she was a girl of a very slow growth, and
looked the girl when many a companion of hers of the
same age began to appear the woman.</p>

<p>When another vacation, however, came round, and
Alfred paid his customary call, and was expecting his
little wife, as usual, the door opened slowly, and a tall
young lady entered, and, courtseying, coloured and
walked to a seat next the lady of the house. The visitor
stood up and bowed, and sat down again, without
knowing that it was Jane.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know Jane?” exclaimed her father.</p>

<p>“Jane!” cried Alfred, in an accent of surprise; and
approached his little wife of old, who rose and half gave
him her hand, and courtseying, coloured again, and sat
down again without hardly interchanging a word with
him. No wonder&mdash;she was four inches taller than when
he had last seen her; and her bulk had expanded correspondingly,
while her features, that half a year before
gave one the idea of a sylph that would bound after a
butterfly, had now mellowed in their expression, into the
sentiment, the softness, and the reserve of the woman.</p>

<p>Alfred felt absolutely disappointed. Five minutes before,
he was all volubility. No sooner was one question
answered than he proposed another&mdash;and he had so
many capital stories for Jane, when she came down&mdash;and
yet, when Jane did come down, he sat as though he
had not a word to say for himself. In short, everything
and everybody in the house seemed to have changed
along with its young mistress; he felt no longer at home
in it, as was his wont; and, in less than a quarter of an
hour he made his bow and departed, <span class="smcap">AND WAS NEVER
NEVER HEARD OF MORE</span>.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> Woman&mdash;aye!</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> You are always railing at our sex.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> And without reason?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Without either rhyme or reason; you’d be
miserable beings without us, for all that.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> Sometimes: there is no general rule without
an exception; I could name some very good
women&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Without the head, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> With a head, and with a heart too.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> That’s a wonder!</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> It would be still greater if I could not;
for instance, there is Mrs Dawson, the best of wives;
always at home, whenever you call, always in good
humour, always neat and clean, sober and discreet.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> I wish you were tied to her. Always at
home! the greatest gossiper in the parish; she may
well smile, she has nothing to ruffle her temper; neat
and clean&mdash;she has nothing else to do;&mdash;sober&mdash;she can
take a glass as well as her neighbours; discreet&mdash;that’s
another word, she can tip a wink: but I detest scandal;
I am surprised you didn’t say she was handsome?</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> So she is, in my eye.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> You have a fine eye, to be sure; you’re an
excellent judge of beauty; what do you think of her
nose?</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> She’s a fine woman in spite of her nose.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Fine feathers make fine birds; she can paint
her withered cheeks, and pencil her eyebrows.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> You can do the same, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> My cheeks don’t want paint, nor my eyebrows
pencilling.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> True; the rose of youth and beauty is
still on your cheeks, and your brow the bow of Cupid.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> You once thought so; but that moving
mummy, Molly Dawson, is your favourite. She’s, let
me see, no gossip, and yet she’s found in every house
but her own; and so silent too, when she has all the
clack to herself; her tongue is as thin as a sixpence
with talking; with a pair of eyes burned into the
socket, and painted panels into the bargain; and then
as to scandal&mdash;but her tongue is no scandal.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> Take care, there’s such a thing as standing
in a white sheet!</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Curse you! you would provoke a saint.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> You seem to be getting into a passion.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Is it any wonder? A white sheet! You
ought to be tossed in a blanket. Handsome! I can’t
forget that word: my charms are lost on such a tasteless
fellow as you.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> The charms of your tongue.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Don’t provoke me, or I’ll fling this dish at
you head.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> Well, I have done.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> But I haven’t done: I wish I had drowned
myself the first day I saw you.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> It’s not too late.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> I’d see you hung first.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> You’d be the first to cut me down.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Then I ought to be tied up in your stead.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> I’d cut you down.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> You would?</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> Yes, but I’d be sure you were dead first.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> I cannot bear this any longer.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> Then ’tis time for me to withdraw; I see
by your eyes that the storm is collecting.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> And it shall burst on your head.</p>

<p><i>Husband.</i> I’ll save my poor head, if I can. A good
retreat is better than a bad battle.</p>

<p>(<i>Husband flies, the dish flies after him.</i>)</p>

<h4>THE LATEST PARTICULARS!</h4>

<span class="larger">DREADFUL APPARITION</span></h3>

<p class="center">That appeared last night to Henry &mdash;&mdash; in this street, of Mary &mdash;&mdash;, the shopkeeper’s
daughter round the corner, in a shroud, all covered in white.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;">

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The castle clock struck one&mdash;the night was dark,
drear, and tempestuous.&mdash;Henry set in an antique
chamber of it, over a wood fire, which, in the stupor
of contemplation, he had suffered to decrease into a few
lifeless embers; on the table by him lay the portrait of
Mary&mdash;the features of which were not very perfectly
disclosed by a taper, that just glimmered in the socket.
He took up the portrait, however, and gazing intensely
upon it, till the taper, suddenly burning brighter, discovered
to him a phenomenon he was not less terrified
than surprised at.&mdash;The eyes of the portrait moved;&mdash;the
features from an angelic smile, changed to a look of
solemn sadness; a tear stole down each cheek, and the
bosom palpitated as with sighing.</p>

<p>Again the clock struck <i>one</i>&mdash;it had struck the same
hour but ten minutes before.&mdash;Henry heard the castle
gate grate on its hinges&mdash;it slammed too&mdash;the clock
struck one again&mdash;and a deadly groan echoed through
the castle. Henry was not subject to superstituous
fears&mdash;neither was he a coward;&mdash;yet a hero of romance
might have been justified in a case like this,
should he have betrayed fear.&mdash;Henry’s heart sunk
within him&mdash;his knees smote together, and upon the
chamber door being opened, and his name uttered in a
hollow voice, he dropped the portrait to the floor; and
sat, as if rivitted to the chair, without daring to lift up
his eyes. At length, however, as silence again prevailed,
he ventured for a moment to raise his eyes,
when&mdash;my blood freezes as I relate it&mdash;before him
stood the figure of Mary in a shroud&mdash;her beamless
eyes fixed upon him with a vacant stare; and her bared
bosom exposing a most deadly gash. “Henry, Henry,
Henry!” she repeated in a hollow tone&mdash;“Henry! I
am come for thee! thou hast often said that death with
me was preferable to life without me; come then, and
enjoy with me all the ecstacies of love these ghastly
features, added to the contemplation of a charnel-house,
can inspire;” then, grasping his hand with her icy
fingers, he swooned; and instantly found himself&mdash;&mdash;stretched
on the hearth of his master’s kitchen; a
romance in his hand, and the house dog by his side,
whose cold nose touching his hand, had awaked him.</p>

</div>

<p>George Williams was the son of a merchant of some
eminence, by whom, at the age of twenty-two, he was
admitted to a share of the business, and, in a few
months afterwards, was rendered completely happy by
obtaining the hand of Susan Halts, a beautiful and accomplished
girl, to whom he had been attached from the
earliest dawn of passion in his breast.</p>

<p>A delightful cottage, elegantly furnished, with grounds
laid out according to the most approved rules of modern
art, and heightened into affection by the exquisite taste
of Susan, received the happy pair. Doting on each
other, loving and beloved by their parents, respected by
a numerous circle of friends, easy in their circumstances,
elegant in their tastes, congenial in their pursuits, their
bliss knew no alloy. George’s daily absence from town
was but for a few hours, and the pleasure of meeting
amply repaid the affectonate Susan for the pain of
separation.</p>

<p>Thus smoothly did their lives glide on during three
years and a half, and a boy and girl, beautiful as
cherubs, had crowned their loves; when one afternoon
George returned to their beloved home, and hastily
sought the apartment in which his Susan was accustomed
to lay out their simply-elegant repast, intrusting
to no one the pleasing task of providing for the refreshment
of her bosom lord.</p>

<p>He opened the door&mdash;he beheld her at the table, and
ran forward to imprint his welcome kiss upon her ruby
lips; but what words can describe his sensation on
beholding her eyes’ accustomed brilliancy quenched in
tears, and pearly drops chasing each other in quick succession
down her lovely cheeks!</p>

<p>“Gracious Heaven!” he exclaimed, “what is the
cause of this? Tell me, dear Susan, tell me, I beseech
you, what dire calamity has visited our hitherto-happy
roof. Speak, I entreat you!”</p>

<p>She was all silent, and her tears continued to flow.</p>

<p>“O Heaven!” he exclaimed, in mental agony of
apprehension, “has anything befallen our lovely
infants? Is Henry&mdash;is Maria&mdash;speak&mdash;are&mdash;they&mdash;can
they be&mdash;oh, I feel a father’s pangs&mdash;ah, beloved
infants! Tell me, for pity’s sake, tell me, dear Susan;
strike me dead at once with dire intelligence, but do
not let me die by the protracted agonies of uncertainty!”</p>

<p>She became violently convulsed, and George, in the
greatest excitement, rang the bell violently. A servant
entered, and to his broken interrogations of “Where
are the children?&mdash;what has happened to your mistress?&mdash;tell
me this instant what has befallen your mistress!&mdash;what
dreadful accident has occurred?” Answer&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lawk, sir, you are so passionate and hasty; you
won’t give a body time to speak.”</p>

<p>“Death and fury, idiot!” exclaimed the exasperated
George; “tell me this instant what to think, or by
Heaven&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lawk-a-daisey, sir, why, if you must know, then,
missus has been <i>peeling some onions to fry with the steak</i>,
and it is so strong it’s got into her <span class="smcap">EYES</span>, that’s all

<span class="largest">THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD.</span></h3>

<p class="center">“’Tis from high life high characters are drawn.”&mdash;<i>Pope.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My Lord and Lady, who reside not a hundred miles
from this neighbourhood, sat by the fireside in the
drawing room; his Lordship on the right hand&mdash;her
Ladyship on the left. The fire was dull, so was his
Lordship; the weather was dull, so was her Ladyship.
His Lordship moved the poker from the right hand side
of the fireplace to that of the left: her Ladyship moved
it back again. His Lordship scratched his left ear;
her Ladyship scratched her right&mdash;violently too&mdash;and
then quitted the room. His Lordship rang the bell. A
footman entered. He was clad for a journey.</p>

<p>“John,” said his Lordship, “has Tattersall sent the
horses?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Lordship,” said John, “they are at the
door?”</p>

<p>“Four of them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Do they look creditable?”</p>

<p>“Perfect, your honour! Full of flesh and rampart
spirit, pawing up the stones.”</p>

<p>“What colour?”</p>

<p>“Bay, my Lord.”</p>

<p>“Ah! the right colour, Bays, for a poet; and I am a
poet: that is, I used to rhyme when I was in love. Is
the lumber ready, John?”</p>

<p>“Right, my Lord.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then tell Her Honourable Ladyship I wait her
presence in the water&mdash;. No! no! in the&mdash;the&mdash;library,
I mean. Yes, the library, John&mdash;mind&mdash;the
library.”</p>

<p>John disappeared. Presently her Ladyship’s little
feet&mdash;or <i>pettitoes</i>, as his Lordship was wont to call them&mdash;were
heard pit-pat-pat-pit on the stairs. Her Ladyship
was attired in a fashionably made riding-habit,
with no ornament but a plain gold chain suspended
round the neck, to which was attached a massive eye-glass.</p>

<p>“Hannah Maria Matilda, my duck&mdash;my dove,” said
his Lordship, “are you ready?”</p>

<p>“At your Lordship’s service&mdash;you <i>goose</i>&mdash;I mean
duck o’diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Your Ladyship’s slave is proud to see you look so
well. As you are ready, I am ready&mdash;I am ready, my
duck&mdash;but one kiss before we go.”</p>

<p>“Has your Lordship determined where we shall
go?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes&mdash;into the country.”</p>

<p>“But the country has points, parts, places. To
which?”</p>

<p>“Oh, any one! the country is all the same, love!
Hedges, ditches, cows, rustics, crows, and mile-stones.
It’s all the same&mdash;all one&mdash;here or there. Where would
you like to go?”</p>

<p>“Right: let me see. The sea? aye, the sea-side.
John, which side is the sea-side?”</p>

<p>“Really, my Lord, I can’t de-cide!”</p>

<p>“Where’s Tattersall? O Tattersall, my Lady and I
are going to sea. Are those <i>sea horses</i>?”</p>

<p>“No my Lord, regular cockneys, that won’t go
further than one stage from London; them that takes
you the last stage are <i>horse marines</i>.”</p>

<p>“Tattersall, you are a wag.”</p>

<p>“Your Lordship’s wit is catching.”</p>

<p>“Tattersall&mdash;to the point; where’s the sea?”</p>

<p>“All round the world, my Lord.”</p>

<p>“Hannah Maria Matilda, my love, we are going all
round the world. Pshaw! John, why don’t you remember
your memory? We want to go out of town.”</p>

<p>“Brighthelmston is a nice place, my Lord.”</p>

<p>“Who lives there?”</p>

<p>“My grandmother, my Lord&mdash;Mrs Smith.”</p>

<p>“Hannah Maria Matilda, my love, Brighthelmston
is a nice place, and John’s grandmother lives there&mdash;a
Mrs. Smith. Did you ever hear that name before, my
Lady?”</p>

<p>“My Lord, our friend, Sir Arthur, has a mansion in
that neigbourhood, and I long to see his lovely niece
Ophelia.”</p>

<p>“Fore-gad, my Lady, well remembered, we’ll off to
Brighthelmston, call on Sir Arthur, stand sponsors for
his newly-born heir, and&mdash;and&mdash;and John, run to
Rundell and Bridges, and order a coral, to present to
the young teeth-cutting baronet.”</p>

<p>“London Bridges! my Lord. What do you want
with the London Bridges. We can’t take them with us
to Brighthelmston.”</p>

<p>“Why you silly stupid&mdash;duck o’diamonds I mean,
I did not say London Bridges! but Rundell and Bridges,
the eminent gold and silversmiths, who live somewhere
in the abominable city, up King Ludgate’s Hill&mdash;I
think the <i>dem’med</i> name of the place is called&mdash;a place
where King Ludgate took up his ten or twenty thousand
men, or million men&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;yes, brought them
down again&mdash;something of that sort&mdash;you understand.”</p>

<p>All was prepared. Smack went the whip. Off went
the horses. Her Ladyship went into the right hand
corner of the carriage, and his Lordship on the left
hand side; and the next morning it was announced in
the <i>Post</i> that Lord &mdash;&mdash; and his Lady had gone out
of town.</p>

<p>On Saturday last, Colonel H&mdash;&mdash;, of the Lancers,
eloped with the fair and beautiful Miss M&mdash;&mdash;n, Ward
to Squire <i>March</i>, of Holt, Norfolk, while the Squire is
on a visit to his Nephew in London: the happy couple
took the direction to Gretna, and both (particularly the
lady) appeared highly pleased they were in possession
of such a <i>golden</i> opportunity.&mdash;Also, the same day, at
the same hour, in a similar vehicle, and same direction&mdash;Farmer
Stubble bore off the youthful Wife of the
Squire; they all started off in a merry mood, each singing
‘<i>Little Love is a Mischievous Boy</i>,’ and ‘<i>Begone
Dull Care</i>;’ or rather that verse commencing with ‘<i>My
Wife shall Dance, and I will Sing</i>’ which was sung by
the gentlemen in great humour.&mdash;They had several interviews
during the time the old gentleman was labouring
under severe attacks of the gout, which confined
him to his room, and gave the Colonel and Farmer opportunities
to breathe love-strains in the anxious ears of
his Wife and Ward.&mdash;The Colonel left a facetious letter
at the Squire’s house, against his return, the following
of which is a copy (forwarded to us by the gallant Son
of Mars); but, thinking it too good to keep secret, we
have taken the opposite course, and given it publicity.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have prevailed upon your trusty ‘MESSENGER,’
Tom ‘HERALD,’ who I find a true ‘ENGLISHMAN,’
to take this Letter with the ‘DISPATCH’ of a
‘COURIER,’ and forward it by the ‘EVENING MAIL,’
as it is now too late for the ‘POST.’ It is sent for the
‘EXPRESS’ purpose of informing you that I am on
the happy Road to Gretna, with the young Lady you are
‘GUARDIAN’ to: she tells me you have, in the most
gross manner, offended her, and that she is happy she is
out of your clutches; for, she says, you lost a few weeks
ago, a valuable ‘STAR,’ and had the audacity to throw
imputations on her character, and went so far as to
‘EXAMINE HER’ yourself, which you cannot retract,
as your Ostler, ‘PIERCE EGAN,’ was a close ‘OBSERVER;’
but really, sir, ‘COMMON SENSE ’ and common
decency ought to have taught you better: but take
care, my old boy, the young lady declares she will become
an ‘ADVERTISER’&mdash;that is to say, she will
publish a ‘CHRONICLE’ of your character in all the
‘NEWSPAPERS;’ therefore prepare to vindicate yourself.
You must know, my old Guardian, I have prevailed
upon her to let <i>me</i> become her future ‘MONITOR’
and Husband, which she has most willingly consented
to; as she says the Belle’s life she has experienced while
with you, is very different to a ‘BELLE’S LIFE IN
LONDON;’ therefore she now prefers being a <i>Wife</i> to
a ‘<i>Belle</i>,’ either in London or the Country.&mdash;I make no
doubt there will be a glorious ‘HUE AND CRY’ about
us, when ‘THE NEWS’ gets abroad; but we are both
of an independent spirit, and care not what ‘THE
WORLD’ says.&mdash;Your <i>dear</i> Wife wishes me to say that
she told the ‘WATCHMAN’ to give a sharp look out,
and likewise gave particular injunctions to the Gardener
to untie ‘SPHYNX’ every night while you are absent,
and turn it into the yard, as you wished.&mdash;She likewise
wishes me to say you will find your ‘JOURNAL’ and
‘LEDGER’ <i>secured</i> in your iron <i>safe</i>, the key of which
is&mdash;‘in my pocket.’&mdash;You must know I am not a
stranger to you, my old buck&mdash;my name I will make
you acquainted with on my return. I have had a
‘WEEKLY REVIEW’ of you and my pretty partner
at Church, which has been a ‘WEEKLY REGISTER’
in my thoughts; and likewise a <i>daily correspondence</i>
with your then Ward, which has been like <i>daily bread</i>
to me.&mdash;You have always appeared to me to be the true
‘ENGLISH GENTLEMAN’&mdash;that is to say, a true
‘JOHN BULL’ of the old ‘STANDARD;’ but if
report speak true, you are very apt to get in ‘THE
SUN,’ which I must say is a disgraceful thing, considering
‘THE AGE’ you have now arrived at; therefore,
my old cripple, since you are gone to learn the state of
‘THE TIMES’ in London, I am a ‘TRAVELLER’ to
to another part of ‘THE GLOBE,’ and have taken the
liberty of putting your ‘ATLAS’ in my pocket, as a
guide to the different Countries we may wish to visit:&mdash;therefore,
trusting the <i>gout</i> may prevent you from
pursuing us, and also thanking you in behalf of Farmer
Stubble, for the great relief you afforded him when he
was in distress, and thereby keeping him in out of
‘THE GAZETTE;’ for which, he says, as one good
turn deserves another, he has felt great <i>pleasure</i> in
taking a <i>trouble</i> off your hands.&mdash;Your dear Wife begs
you will not make yourself in the least uncomfortable
about &mdash;&mdash; as she is very happy under the protection of
‘<span class="smcap">A. Stubble</span>.’ and hopes <i>you</i> are equally so with the
‘<span class="smcap">Thorns</span>,’ and remain,</p>

<p class="sig2">Dear Friend,</p>

<p class="sig1">Your sincere ‘<i>well wisher</i>,’</p>

<p class="right">G. H.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;You had best not attempt to come after us, or
there will be a civil war, as sure as your name’s March;
for the <i>Ladies</i> swear they will <i>tear your eyes out</i>, if you
come near <i>them</i>,; the <i>Farmer</i> swears he will <i>thrash</i> you
as long as he can stand over you; and I (as a Soldier)
am in duty bound, for the Ladies’ protection, to <i>shoot</i>
you&mdash;therefore you know your doom. G. H.</p>

<p class="noindent">Copy of a Love Letter sent to a Young Lady:&mdash;</p>

<p>My Dear,</p>

<p>Kisses may be reckoned among the luxuries of life, rather
than among its necessaries; and the reason why so many are fond
of indulging in them is, because they belong to the superfluities of
this world, and contribute neither to the nourishment of the body
nor to the welfare of the soul, but merely afford a moment’s gratification.
Formal or ceremonious kisses are like manufactured flowers&mdash;very
fine in appearance, but wanting in fragrance; and their
superabundance only goes to show that the present is a very artificial
state of society, as the monkey said when his master put
breeches on him. The common custom of kissing the Bible in
order to give the appearance of solemnity to an oath, unless the
kiss be hot from the heart, is impious mockery, and ought never to
be practised in a country like this, where Christianity and common
sense are supposed to be closely combined. This cold kind of kissing
produces no blissful excitement, and often leads to bad results;
and I have no doubt but the old woman found more pleasure when
she kissed her cow, than half of the young men who bestow busses
upon the cheek of beauty, unwarmed by the fire of affection. My
dear, you may go to your private evening parties, where all is
gaiety, joiety, and hilarity&mdash;where the lovely angels of earth,
dressed in the snowy robes of purity, look tempting enough to
make a saint turn sinner, and perform a pilgrimage from paradise
to perdition, for the sake of a single glorious smack. Go, then,
and feast till you fatten on forfeited kisses; but be assured that,
although they may be attended with some little sport and amusement,
they are just as destitute of real ecstacy as a fox’s back is of
fur in the month of June, or an oyster of fine flavour in August.
True bliss only attends the warm kiss of fervent love. When a
young man presses the girl that he sincerely loves to his bosom&mdash;when
heart meets heart&mdash;when soul mingles with soul&mdash;and when
lips meet lips&mdash;oh! then come exquisite touches of tenderness!&mdash;then
he cannot help feeling a sort of furziness all over!&mdash;and she
must unquestionably feel as though she were ready to pin-feather
at the moment. Such, my dear, are the delightful, but indescribable
sensations attending the kiss of pure and unadulterated love.
But he that kisses only to deceive and seduce, imbibes a poison at
the time, which rankles in his bosom, and induces more or less of
grief and mortification, according to the injury inflicted. I hold
him a very Judas at best; and if he were to go straightway and
hang himself, society would reckon his loss as an unlooked for and
fortunate gain. My dear, as for me, I don’t dive very deeply into
miscellaneous kissing, and consequently kiss but few; but when I
do kiss, an explosion takes place which must convince all within
hearing that it originates from the heart, and is meant in earnest.
There was a time, in my schoolboy days, when I could extract the
sweets of a kiss as calmly, composedly, and I may say as coldly as a
bee sucks the honey from a hollyhock; but now I never undertake
the business of bussing unless I go into it with a heart heated in
the blaze of enthusiasm. A mother kisses her child; true lovers
do the same to one another, and no evil consequences ensue; doves
bill and coo, and they know no more about the practised arts of love
than a man knows when he goes to sleep; but, oh! this kissing to
gain some mean, mercenary, or unlawful end, ought never to be
countenanced. To kiss in jest, as is often practised by chaps among
the girls, is productive of no absolute harm or actual good yet the
young men love to indulge in it; and so long as the amusement is
innocent in itself, I have no objections to their gratifying their
naughty but wicked propensities to their heart’s content. But they
must be careful whom they kiss and how they kiss. Some girls will
undergo the pleasurable punishment as quietly as a good-natured
child submits to baptism by sprinkling&mdash;some twist and squirm like
an eel while being skinned, and either return a smart slap in the
face, or exercise no other defence by merely saying “Why ain’t you
ashamed!” And then again, there are others whom it is as
dangerous to attempt to kiss as it would be to attempt to break open
the trunk of an elephant. Look out for this latter sort, for they
have teeth like tigers and claws like a wild cat’s, and you must
keep a respectful distance, or pay dearly for your rashness. Married
men may greet one another with a holy kiss, but don’t kiss each
other’s wives, lest the green-eyed monster haunt the blooming
bowers of matrimony, and every beautiful blossom of connubial
bliss be blighted in the frost-bringing breeze of jealousy. I want you,
my dear, to kiss and get married; and then devote your time to the
study of morality and money-making. Then let your home be provided
with such comforts and necessaries as piety, pickles, potatoes,
pots and kettles, brushes, brooms, benevolence, bread, charity, cheese,
crackers, faith, flour, affection, cider, sincerity, onions, integrity, vinegar,
virtue, wine, and wisdom. Have all these always on hand, and
happiness will be with you. Eat moderately, go about business after
breakfast, lounge a little after dinner, chat after tea, and kiss after
quarrelling; and all the joy, the peace and the bliss the earth can
afford shall be yours, till the grave closes over you, and your spirit
is borne to a brighter and happier world. So may it be.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON A</span><br />
BLASPHEMER,</h3>

<p class="center">As manifested to Mr Louis, a Farmer, between Brighton and Hastings, who, while in the act of blaspheming, was struck
motionless, in which state he remained six weeks, with his account of the Horrors he endured while in his death-like Trance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/divider-horizontal-1.jpg" width="250" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following startling intelligence was received in London
a few weeks ago (as many thousands can remember), from a
very pious and Christian lady named Thompson, residing at a
Training College in the vicinity of Brighton, Sussex, and
which may be said to be one of the most awful visitations
that ever befel any person. At a village between Brighton
and Hastings, the farmers had been grumbling about the
weather. A lady was passing a field in which Mr Louis, a
farmer, was standing, remarked that his corn looked nice.
“Yes,” he replid, “it would look nice, if God Almighty
would sleep for six weeks,” and directly the man became stiff,
and has remained in that position until Tuesday last, when,
amidst a violent storm of wind and rain, he recovered the use
of his faculties. It appears that the unfortunate man’s wife
and friends had been assiduously watching him since August
the 14th, and early on Tuesday morning, September the 25th,
whilst a violent storm of wind and rain was raging, his limbs
were observed to lose their rigid appearance, and his wife
immediately ran to him, when, in a few moments he opened
his eyes, looked around, and clasping his hands together, raised
his eyes to Heaven, and exclaimed, “My God! my God;
what have I done?” and immediately fell to the earth in a
swoon. They raised him from the ground, and applied
restoratives to him, and in a short time had the pleasure of
seeing him come too, when they conveyed him home and put
him to bed, and we are happy to say under the kind attention
of his wife he rapidly recovered.</p>

<p>The unfortunate man states that when he went off in his
death-like trance he had, for the first few days a perfect
knowledge of all that was passing around him, and, oh! it
was impossible to describe the horrible anguish that he
experienced at the thought of standing in that position for
ever (he says he never expected to be relieved from his awful
position), as a warning to the unrighteous wicked blasphemer;
then to hear the remarks of some of his Christian friends,
many of whom had tried to persuade him to alter his evil
course of life, but whom he had treated with scorn, was
doubly terribly horrible. He says, that after he went off in a
stupor, and had lost his sense and feeling, as far as regards
this earth, he thought he was carried along by some unseen
power, and alighted in a dark dismal barren looking region,
where the smell of brimstone was almost suffocating, and the
horrible noises that surrounded him was enough to drive any
person mad. He was now carried along by the same unseen
power till he came to a dark narrow passage, at the end of
which a sight the most horrible met his view. There was
an immense abyss in the earth which the eye could not command,
which was filled with an immense number of human
forms, all writhing and twisting amidst the horrors of liquid
fire.</p>

<p>Now and then a troop of young demons could be seen
putting some miserable wretch to horrible torture by tossing
him about in the flames with forks, or picking the skin and
toe nails from his body; the cries and shrieks of the miserable
wretches were so heartrendering that he fell down in a swoon,
and on coming to himself, he thought he was in a room at
home, with a bible in his hand, when an angel appeared to
him, and said, “What you have seen is the reward of unrighteousness
and wicked blasphemers, and other sinners, and
may this be a warning to you to alter your evil course.” He
held a blazing torch in one hand, and a flaming torch in the
other, and shook them as he departed. The unfortunate man
shortly after began to return to a conscious state, and came to
himself, as we have before stated.</p>

<p>He has been visited by a number of religious people, and is
quite an altered man. He reads his bible, and is extremely
happy in the company of an elderly Divine, who reads and
explains the holy book to him. He has expressed himself
ready to give lectures when he has thoroughly recovered.</p>

<p>It is a shocking thing when we come to contemplate on it,
that a man, who was in an independant station of life, should,
for the sake of gaining a few more pounds out of an acre or
two of land, make use of such an impious expression. It is
not as if he would give any share of the abundance to the
poor and needy, but it was a selfish sordid spirit that the man
possessed, prompted by the workings of the evil one; and,
now we can see, that the Almighty, although invisible to the
human eye can see and hear, and know our most inmost
thoughts, and punishes us at a moment when we least expect
it, and in a manner that we should never think of. We must
not forget the punishment of Lot’s wife, mentioned in the
bible, who, for disobeying the instructions of the Lord, was
turned into a pillar of salt. Let us hope this will be a
warning to all persons against blaspheming.</p>

<h3><a name="STRANGE_WARNING" id="STRANGE_WARNING"></a>STRANGE WARNING<br /><br />
<span class="smaller">TO A</span><br /><br />
REPROBATE PUBLICAN.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Bethnal-Green, and near the school
house, there is a public-house known
by the name of the Gibraltar, which was
long kept by one John Harris, a native of
Birmingham, and silver plater by trade.
This man for many years, encouraged by his
great success in business, led a very irregular
life, insomuch that he lost his trade in the
public-house, and getting into a disorderly
way entirely, the parish officers and justice
refused to renew his license, and for a whole
year he was fain to keep his house close.
During this interval, having dismissed his
servants, and his wife having left him for
some words which had happened, as he sat
by the parlour fire, it being the winter time,
he heard the bar bell ring, which made him
wonder much, knowing there was nobody in
the house but himself. At first he paid but
little attention, but upon hearing it distinctly
a second time, he got up and went to the
back door, suspecting some one had entered
that way and was putting a trick upon him;
but finding all safe, he returned to the fireside,
wondering much at the oddness of the
thing, when all of a sudden the bell fell a
ringing again, though not in so quick a tone
as before, but somewhat more regularly, as
if the hand that pulled it held it for a while.</p>

<p>Disturbed at this extraordinary call, he
got up, determined to discover the cause,
and taking the poker in his hand, being the
first thing he could lay hold on, he passed
through the bar into the back room, where,
to his great astonishment and terror, for he
allowed that he was severely frightened, he
beheld the figure of a good-looking female
personage, dressed in brown, much like a
Quaker, seated in a chair, between the two
back windows, and leaning upon a long
stick, which seemed to support her.</p>

<p>At first Mr Harris was too much affected
to speak, for though very valiant and noisy
in company, there was something about the
figure before him which declared her not to
be of this world: besides, his own conscience
upbraided him with more evil than his
memory could just then recollect. However,
he summoned power enough to put the old
foolish question, “what art thou?” and with
that fell on his knees in a devout manner to
pray. “What I am is not now my business
to relate, but what you may hereafter become
if you do not amend your life and manners;
so get up man, and remember the warning
voice of one from the dead. You have but
a few years to live, make the most of your
time, and train up your daughter <i>Phœbe</i> in a
good way, and keep her from such and such
company, or she will die young, violently,
and by the force of justice. Consider her
life is just now in your hands, a little time
will place it out of your power to reverse
the evil that awaits her.&mdash;Remember this,
and live accordingly.”&mdash;With this she
seemed to strike the ground with her stick
and immediately disappeared, leaving Mr
Harris much astonished at what he had both
heard and seen, and only lamenting that he
had no witness to the truth of this accident.</p>

<p>Be it as it will, it produced a wonderful
alteration in him for the best; and though
his former companions laughed at him for
becoming a methodist, he ever after adhered
to the paths of prudence and sobriety, and
remained a very orderly and sober man, and
from his invariable relation of this matter we
have no doubt of its truth.</p>

<p>The prediction with respect to his daughter
Phœbe was too fatally accomplished a few
years since, she being burnt for treason as it
is called, that is, for counterfeiting the
current coin called a shilling.</p>

</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About the year of our Lord, 18&mdash;, near
unto Chester-in-the-Street, there lived
one Walker, a yeoman of good estate, and
a widower who had a young woman to his
kinswoman that kept his house, who was by
the neighbours suspected to be with child;
and was towards the dark of the evening one
night sent away with one Mark Sharp, who
was a collier, or one that digged coals under
ground, and one that had been born in Blackburn-Hundred,
in Lancashire: and so she
was not heard of a long time, and little or
no noise was made about it. In the winter
time after, one James Graham, or Grime,
(for so in that country they called him) being
a miller, and living about two miles from the
place where Walker lived, was one night
alone very late in the mill grinding corn;
and at about twelve or one o’clock at night
he came down stairs, having been putting
corn in the hopper, the mill doors being fast
shut, there stood a woman upon the midst
of the floor with her hair about her head
hanging down all bloody, with five large
wounds on her head. He being much
affrighted and amazed, began to bless himself,
and at last asked her who she was, and
what she wanted? To which she said, “I
am the spirit of such a woman, who lived
with Walker; and being got with child by
him, he promised to send me to a private
place, where I should be well looked to, until
I was brought to bed, and well again, and
then I should come again and keep his house.”
“And accordingly,” said the apparition, “I
was one night late sent away with one Mark
Sharp, who, upon a moor (naming a place
the miller knew) slew me with a pick (such
as men dig coals withal) and gave me these
five wounds, and after threw my body into
a coal pit hard by, and hid the pick under a
bank: and his shoes and stockings being
bloody he endeavoured to wash them, but
seeing the blood would not wash out, he hid
them there.” And the apparition further
told the miller that he must be the man to
reveal it, or else she must still appear and
haunt him. The miller returned home very
sad and heavy, but spoke not one word of
what he had seen, but eschewed as much at
he could to stay in the mill within night
without company, thinking thereby to escape
the seeing again of that frightful apparition.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding, one night when it
began to be dark, the apparition met him
again, and seemed very fierce and cruel, and
threatened him, that if he did not reveal
the murder, she would continually pursue
and haunt him. Yet for all this, he still
concealed it until St. Thomas’ Eve, before
Christmas, when, being after sunset, walking
in his garden, she appeared again and then
so threatened and affrighted him, that he
faithfully promised to reveal it next morning.</p>

<p>In the morning he went to a magistrate,
and made the whole matter known, with all
the circumstances; and diligent search being
made the body was found in a coal pit, with
five wounds in the head, and the pick and
shoes, and stockings yet bloody, in every
circumstances as the apparition had related
unto the miller: whereupon Walker and
Mark Sharpe were both apprehended, but
would confess nothing. At the assizes
following they were arraigned, found guilty,
condemned, and executed, but we could
never hear that they confessed the fact.
There were some who reported that the
apparition did appear to the Judge, or foreman

</div>

<p>Last night the following curious circumstance
took place in a house in this
neighbourhood, which occasioned a great
deal of merriment. Six young women,
whose names are as follows:&mdash;Jane Trustsoot,
Ann Dingle, Mary Prause, Priscilla
Richards, Harriett Pridhame, and Mary
Twining, having previously agreed together,
went to the residence of a notorious
fortune teller about nine o’clock, to dive
into the history of their future destiny, or if
possible, to gain information respecting
their intended husbands or future sweethearts.
On entering his apartment, the
timid girls became rather abashed, but after
some words had passed between them, this
famous cutter of cards began his curious
ceremony.</p>

<p>First consulting his oracle, which consists
of an old book written in unintelligible
characters, he took an old pack of cards
which he shuffled several times, and placed
them in a form of a circle, and again
consulted his oracle, he then
related unto them their
destiny. The enquiring girls
wished to know if he could
not tell the names of their
sweethearts; he answered in
the affirmative, and said, if
they would give him 2s. 6d.
each, he would bring them
into the room; the girls said
they had not so much, and he
told them to raise what they
could, which amounted in all
to 3s. 6d. They were then
placed in a ring, and the old
man began muttering some
words and shuffling his cards,
when three loud knocks were
heard at the door. The
sounds appeared to proceed from the staircase.
Shortly after the knocking had
ceased, the door slowly opened, and the
figure of a tall man with an unnatural cast
of countenance entered the room and took
a seat opposite the affrighted maids. The
appearance had a white ghastly head, and
was dressed in the style of a cavalier of the
time of Charles II; but what was most
remarkable, the body was a mere shadow,
it was a thing of vapour, for the back of
the chair was plainly discernible through
it. It raised its hand three times in a
menacing attitude, three times at the young
women, which so alarmed them, that they
all commenced screaming and wildly ran
from the room&mdash;the house was aroused&mdash;the
police was called in&mdash;but no trace of
the apparition was visible, unless a curious
odour which perfumed the apartment might
be considered so.</p>

<p>A most remarkable and curious circumstance that
took place last night at a well-known house in this
town, kept by a person of the name of Sarah Smith, a
well-known fortune teller.</p>

<p>A party of six young females agreed to go to the
house of the above-mentioned woman and have their
fortunes told. On their arrival at the house not one of
them could be found courageous enough to lead the way
in; at length one (Emma Logo) more bold than the rest
lifted up the latch and walked in, of course followed by
her companions. On entering, the first thing that met
their gaze was the old hag, seated on a three-legged
stool by the fire, with six black cats lying on the hearth
by her side.</p>

<p>The young damsels blushingly told their desire to
know the names of their future husbands, also numerous
other questions, to which the old hag readily complied.</p>

<p>After listening with great attention to the falsehoods
and impossibilities told by this wicked old woman, they
said they were desirous of seeing and knowing the
men who were to be their partners in the great battle
of life, asking her if it was possible, to which she
replied, nothing was impossible to her.</p>

<p>Emma Logo was the first to know her future husband,
whose name was Henry &mdash;&mdash;. Mary Palmer was
the second, whose intended husband’s name was George
&mdash;&mdash;. The third was Jane &mdash;&mdash; (our readers must
pardon us for the omission of her surname, as were it
to be known it would be the ruin of her and her family),
Harry &mdash;&mdash; was the husband of Eliza Smith; and last,
but not least, was Emma All, but to whom the fortune-teller
would not tell her future husband’s name, the
only clue that she gave her was, that he was a very
dark man and always laughing and never out of temper
(?)</p>

<p>The poor deluded young females were on the point of
leaving, when all of a sudden a most terrific and unearthly
noise was heard at the door; at the same time
there was seen a gigantic figure with head, legs, and a
tail of the most enormous size; it had eyes like flames
of living fire, and from its mouth proceeded forth dense
volumes of smoke, completely filling the house; the
smell of sulphur was so great that for hours after the
visitation it was found impossible to dispel the suffocating
fumes which remained; the terror of the party may be
better imagined than described, and who with the old
hag as their leader set up some most dreadful shrieks,
completely rousing the whole neighbourhood. Some of
the neighbours rushed to the house from whence the
shrieks proceeded, and found the furniture in the
greatest disorder, the cards spread all over the room,
and the six black cats were altogether on the top of the
house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing is a statement made by one of the
young women, and is published as a warning to <span class="smcap">ALL</span>
young females not to believe in such silly and superstitious
nonsense, nor encourage those wicked old hags
who prey upon the thoughtless and ignorant. It is all
the devil’s work; and it frequently happens that servant
girls are induced to rob their masters and mistresses
through the agency of these pests of society. Beware!
girls, beware! spurn all who attempt to lead you
astray; do not be deceived, but look on fortune-telling
as a delusion and a snare.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>In laying the following interesting and mysterious
case before our readers, we vouch for its authenticity,
and considering the good results that are likely to
follow from the examination of the circumstances, we at
once proceed with the details.</p>

<h4>NARRATIVE.</h4>

<p>The Rev. John Miller has been engaged in the ministry
since the year 1841. He is a man most remarkable
for his piety, of a mild and gentle disposition, and very
kind to the poor. In the pulpit he was eloquent;
his language forcible and persuasive. He is indeed a
good man, a powerful preacher, and of unsullied reputation.
Since the beginning of the present year he has
been in a bad state of health, and during the past
month he grew worse, and on the 14th, whilst his beloved
wife and children were standing round his bed, he
fell into a kind of a doze, and gradually became cold
and rigid. Dr. Truscott was immediately sent for, who
on his arrival pronounced him dead. His sorrowing
family were removed from the room, and the usual preparations
made for laying out the body. Mrs. Miller,
having expressed a wish to have his portrait painted
after he was placed in the coffin, a young lady artist was
soon in attendance for that purpose, and was busily engaged
at her unpleasant task until the third day, and
while looking intently on the pallid features of the deceased,
previous to giving a finishing stroke to the picture,
she perceived a movement of the eye lashes, and
in a moment the reverend gentleman opened his eyes
and said to the young lady, “Who are you?” The
fair young artist, instead of fainting, took instant
measures to complete the restoration of her subject. A
medical gentleman was again called, and in less than an
hour the supposed deceased became so far recovered as
to be able to sit up in bed and converse with his now
rejoicing family and friends.</p>

<p>On the following day he sent for the Rev. J. Ransom,
his colleague in the ministry, Mr Henry Lewis, a member
of his congregation, and before these gentlemen he
made the following disclosures relating to what he had
seen during the time he was in a trance. The account
was taken from Mr Polkinghorne. The following is
<i>verbatim</i> from the original copy.</p>

<p>“When I first fell into that state I was fully aware
that I was supposed to be dead, and could hear my wife
and children crying, and the remarks made by Dr. Truscott.
I attempted to speak, but could not move a single
muscle. The fear of being buried alive terrified me
and filled me with such agonies of mind that I gradually
became unconscious of all earthly things. How long
I continued in this state I know not, but I felt like one
awakening from sleep when I was borne away by an unseen
power to the place of the damned. To attempt to
describe what I saw is utterly impossible: no tongue
can convey any idea of such a place. At that moment
an hideous fiend was about to grasp me in his arms,
when an angel appeared at my side and whispered with
a kind and heavenly voice, ‘Be not afraid, he has no
power on the righteous; this is not your place, let us
go!’ I thought I was then conveyed on angels’ wings
to the abode of the blessed, and to enjoy such a sight
again would be worth an eternity of years in this world.
I was surrounded suddenly with a glorious light, the
exceeding brightness thereof was such a sight I had
never before seen, and saw such things it is impossible
to represent, and heard such ravishing melodious harmony
as I can never utter, and I saw innumerable
bright attendants, who welcomed me into the blissful
seat of happiness, having in all their countenances an
air of perfect joy, and of the highest satisfaction.</p>

<p>The ineffable Deity exalted on the high throne of his
glory, receiving the adoration of myriads of angels and
saints, who were singing eternal Hallelujahs and praise
to him. (Well may he be called the Glory of God, for
by his glorious presence Heaven is made what it is).
Amongst the saints I discovered good old Wesley, Whitfield,
and many others, some of whom belonged to this
Town. After I had witnessed these things my heavenly
guide told me that I must remain an inhabitant of this
world for several years to come, as the work I had to do
was not yet accomplished, and proclaim throughout the
land that unless the people repent of their sins and
abominations, evil shall come upon them both in the
town and hamlets, for there shall be wars, rumours of
wars, pestilence and famine, many great men shall fall
by the sword, and whole armies shall be cut off in a
short time, but peace shall be established in the nations
that fear the Lord, and the fruits of the earth shall be
multiplied exceedingly, praise and thanksgiving shall be
heard in every house on the Sabbath; but until the
source of evil is removed,&mdash;go, warn the people, that
they perish not.’ With these words he left me, and I
found myself in darkness, and gradually regained my
senses. When I awoke and saw Miss Hall gazing on
me,&mdash;and you know the rest.”</p>

the same by adding their names to the document as

<p class="center">An Affair which happened in this Neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">
<img src="images/img052.jpg" width="590" height="249" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="center">LONDON:&mdash;H. Such, Printer and Publisher, 177, Union Street, Borough.&mdash;S.E.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young gentleman, going to the house of a very worthy gentleman,
to whom he had the honour to be related&mdash;it happened that
the gentleman’s house at that time was quite full, by reason of a
kinswoman’s wedding that had been lately kept there&mdash;he therefore
told the young gentleman that he was very glad to see him, and
that he was very welcome to him; “but,” said he, “I know not
what I shall do for a lodging for you, for my cousin’s marriage has
not left me a room free but one, and that is haunted; you shall
have a good bed and all other accommodations.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied the young gentleman, “you will very much oblige
me in letting me lie there, for I have often coveted to be in a place
that is haunted.”</p>

<p>The gentleman, very glad that his kinsman was so well pleased
with his accommodation, ordered the chamber to be got ready and
a good fire to be made to air it. When bed time came, the young
gentleman was conducted up to his chamber, which, besides a good
fire, was furnished with all suitable accommodations; and having
recommended himself to the Divine protection, he retired to bed,
where having laid some time awake, and finding no disturbance, he
fell asleep; out of which he was awakened about three o’clock in
the morning, by the opening of the chamber door, and the coming
in of somebody in the appearance of a young woman, having a
night dress on her head, and only her smock on; but he had no
perfect view of her, for his candle was burnt out; and though there
was a fire in the room, yet it gave not light enough to see her
distinctly. But this unknown visitant going to the chimney, took
the poker and stirred up the fire, and by the flaming light thereof
he could discern the appearance of a young gentlewoman more
distinctly; but whether it was flesh and blood, or an airy phantom,
he knew not. This lovely apparition, having stood some time before
the fire, as if to warm herself, at last walked two or three times
about the room, and then came to the bedside, where having stood
a little while, she turned down the bed clothes and got into bed,
pulling the bed clothes upon her, and lay very quiet. The young
gentleman was a little startled at this unknown bedfellow, and on
her approach laid on the further side of the bed, not knowing
whether he had best rise or not. At last, by lying very still, he
perceived his bedfellow to breathe, by which, guessing her to be
flesh and blood, he drew nearer to her, and taking her by the hand,
found it warm, and that it was no airy phantom, but substantial
flesh and blood; and finding she had a ring on her finger, he took
it off unperceived. The gentlewoman being still asleep, he let her
lie without disturbing her or doing anything else than only laying his
hand upon her to discover of what sex she was, which he had just
time to do, when she threw off the bed clothes, and getting up,
walked three or four times round the room, as she had done before,
and then, standing awhile before the door, opened it, went out, and
shut it after her. The young gentleman percieving by this in what
manner the room was haunted, rose up and locked the door on the
inside, and then laid down again, and slept till morning, at which
time the master of the house came to know how he did, and whether
he had seen anything or not. He told him there was an apparition
appeared to him, but he begged as a favour that he would not urge
him to say anything further until the family were altogether. The
gentleman complied with his request, telling him, so long as he was
well he was satisfied.</p>

<p>The desire the whole family had to know the issue of this affair,
made them dress with more expedition than usual, so that there was
a general assembly of the gentlemen and ladies before eleven o’clock,
not one of them being willing to appear in her dishabille. When
they were all together in the great hall, the young gentleman told
them that he had one favour to desire of the ladies before he would
say anything, and that was, whether any of them had lost a ring.
The young gentlewoman, from whose finger it was taken, having
missed it all the morning, and not knowing how she lost it, was glad
to hear of it again, and readily owned she wanted a ring, but whether
lost or mislaid, she knew not. The young gentleman asked her if
that was it, giving it into her hand; which she acknowledging to
be hers, and thanking him, he turned to his kinsman, the master of
the house:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said he, “I can assure you,” taking the young lady
by the hand “this is the lovely spirit by which your chamber is
haunted,” and thereupon repeated what has been related.</p>

<p>Words cannot express the confusion of the young lady at this
relation, who declared herself perfectly ignorant of all that he said;
but believed it might be so because of the ring, which she perfectly
well remembered she had on when she went to bed, and knew not
how she had lost it. This relation gave the company a great deal
diversion; and after all the father declared, that since his daughter
had already gone to bed to his kinsman, it should be his fault if he
did not go to bed to his daughter, he being willing to bestow her
upon him, and give her a good portion. This generous offer was so
advantageous to the young gentleman, that he could by no means
refuse it; and his bedfellow, hearing what her father had said, was
easily prevailed upon to accept him for her husband.</p>

<p>Had that love-sick young lady, Miss Juliet, lived in these unromantic,
matter o’ fact times, when puffery and humbug lead men
on to fame and fortune, instead of integrity, honesty and fair
dealing,&mdash;when ignorant and worthless foreign quacks are fostered
and encouraged, and native merit and native talent left to starve,&mdash;she
would certainly have become duly impressed with the importance
of a “name.” “The Queen’s name is a tower of strength,” and
so think the enterprising commercial geniuses of the present day,
inasmuch as the patronymic of our gracious Sovereign is applied to
all imaginable purposes. We have <i>Victoria</i> washing tubs, mouse-traps,
and mustard-pots, and <i>Albert</i> toasting-forks, shaving-brushes,
and dung-barges, and last, though by no means least, “Albert inexpressibles.”
However, as the young lady alluded to above says,
“a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”</p>

<p>Timothy Shaw, a bandy-legged “ninth part,” with a mouth
sufficiently capacious to admit the largest cabbage that ever
flourished in field or garden, summoned a knowing-looking specimen
of the <i>genus homo</i>, named Gilpin, before the commissioners, for the
sum of 7s, for work and labour performed in the manufacture of a
certain pair of “<i>kicksies</i>,” for the wear of a certain Mr Gilpin.</p>

<p>The defendant, an “artful card,” was described by the plaintiff
as a “’buss cove out of luck,” that is, he had been in the habit of
doing the amiable at the door of a Walworth omnibus, but had lost
his place. The tailor, having blown his nose in that peculiar and
primitive manner which gave rise to a certain riddle tending to
show that the poor man often throws away what the rich man puts
in his pocket, proceeded to “open his case” as follows:&mdash;“Please
yer vorship, I’m a tailor by trade.” And here we must slightly
digress to remark that a disciple of the bodkin and shears, upon
being asked to describe himself, invariably says, “I’m a tailor by
<i>trade</i>.” A celebrated author is of opinion, that this is to prevent
his being considered a <i>tailor by nature</i>. “I’m a tailor by trade,”
said the plaintiff, “and von’t turn my back on the best vorkman in
the wicinity of Tooley street for a slap up fit in the first stile of
fashion, ’cause I regularly takes a trip to the vest-end to pick ’em
up. Twigged the ‘Prince’ t’other day with a new pair of trousers
on,&mdash;had the cut on ’em all right in the turn of a bodkin.”</p>

<p>Commissioner: Really you must be a very clever person to “take
off” the Prince’s inexpressibles so very expeditiously.&mdash;Plaintiff:
Beg pardon, yer vorship, but I vouldn’t be guilty of any sich indelicate
hact, as to “take off” anybody’s breeches.</p>

<p>The Commissioner finding that “snip” had the laugh on his own
side, adjustedhis wig, and requested him to keep to the question.&mdash;Tailor:
So I do, yer vorship; I’ll swear I never tuck not nobody’s
breeches off but me own.</p>

<p>Commissioner: Well, what have you to say about Prince Albert?
I suppose he wears his clothes like other people?&mdash;Tailor: Ah!
that’s all a mistake, ’cause I’ve heerd that some knowing Jarman
has hinwented new fashioned unmentionables, wot all&mdash;</p>

<p>Commissioner: There, there, we don’t want to hear any more of
this nonsense. What have you got to say against the defendant?&mdash;Plaintiff:
Vy, my lord, it’s “a plain unwarnished tale.” Master
Gilpin steers himself into my shop, and ses to me, “Tim, old feller,
I vant you to make me a hout-and-hout pair of <i>kicksies</i>, ’cause I
vonts to show off a bit at <i>Court</i> in ’em.” In course, me lord, I
vos regularly flabbergasted to hear a kiddy as vos only a “buss
cove” talk in sich a way, but it soon comed out as he vos a going
to lodge in Pennyvinkle-court, vich is close in our neighbourwood,
me lord; and then he said he vos a goin to be married. “Poor
devil,” ses I, “you’re a goin to tie a knot as I should be werry
glad to untie.” As bad luck ’ud have it, my old woman heard me,
and didn’t I cotch it nicely.</p>

<p>Commissioner: Well, did you make him any trousers after all?&mdash;Plaintiff:
Oh! yes; and arter altering ’em three times the warmint
would’nt pay a farden.</p>

<p>Commissioner: What did he complain of?&mdash;Plaintiff: ’Cause
they didn’t fit tight to his legs, though I told him it warn’t the
fashion.</p>

<p>The Commissioner told the defendant that he was ready to hear
anything that he might have to say about the matter.&mdash;Defendant:
I was fool enough to let this old spooney have some cloth to make
a pair of trousers, and when I came to try them on, I found them
so tight at the top that I couldn’t button them, and the legs were
large enough to have admitted my whole body. He pretended to
alter them&mdash;they were worse than before.&mdash;Plaintiff: I made them
in the “Albert style,” yer vorship, so that shows the wagabone’s
bad taste.&mdash;Defendant: If Prince Albert ever wore sich a pair of
<i>kicksies</i> as them I’ll eat my hat.</p>

<p>Commissioner: How much are you willing to allow him for his
trouble?&mdash;Defendant: Not the ghost of a mag; why should I?&mdash;ar’n’
he spoiled my breeches?&mdash;Plaintiff: Some people as is werry
ugly, thinks the tailor ought to make ’em look handsome. Now,
my lord, ’cause this pig-headed hobgoblin didn’t look a regular <i>cock
wenus</i> in the breeches, he lays it all to me.</p>

<p>Commissioner: Now if you had contented yourself with making
him look like a “buss cove,” as you describe him, instead of trying
to <i>Albertise</i> him, you would, in all probability, have given satisfaction.
You should never try to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.&mdash;Plaintiff:
That’s very true. It is labour in wain to try to make
a gemman out of sich a wulgar blackguard.&mdash;Defendant: Keep a
civil tongue in your head, old bandy legs.&mdash;Plaintiff: Take a fit,
young gallus. You arn’t no sich a <i>cock wenus</i>, pug-nose, arter all.</p>

<p>Commissioner: We cannot allow this. The defendant will pay
5s and the costs.</p>

<span class="smaller">FOUGHT ON THE</span><br />
FIFTY-TWELFTH DAY OF ROTTENSTICKS</h3>

<p>This memorable battle took place on the Ocean of
Sprats, situated on the Continent of Green Peas, within
half a mile of a Donkey; where Bobby the Ratcatcher
swallowed the Monument, and the poor old soldier was
killed by being drowned in a bog of buttermilk: such an
unseasonable battle was never known before.</p>

<p>It took place on the Fifty-twelfth day, on London
Bridge, between 15 and 160 o’clock in the night.</p>

<p>Arthur Mc Kelly’s nose was knocked into eighteen
thousand pieces and converted into a cheese knife, and
sold in Plum pudding court, going up to Christmas on
the top side of little Bobby the Ratcatcher; the regiment
was commanded by General Pigsfry, and Colonel Beefsteak,
the bone polisher, who lived one thousand and
ninety-nine miles beyond mutton chops, in the parish of
Blackberry pudding, a robust strong man, well fed upon
marrow bones, and Darby O’Daud, Judy Saggin’s son,
was mortally wounded, his second hand coat that was
made and mended by Patrick Mc Patch, three calendar
months beyond the city of Cork. The back buttons
were turned before, and a mail coach could have gone
through the button holes, the sleeves were massacred
and murdered, his waistcoat suddenly took fright,
jumped aside off his back, and tumbled into the trap of
great Calamity, which was fixed within a quarter of an
inch of bad luck. This made him roar out “potatoes”
loud enough to be heard sixteen hundred miles beyond
Buttermilk, and Selim O’Blunder, the second son of
Teddy Humbug, a son to Mr. Nonsense, was terribly
wounded in the understanding by the frightful appearance
of the blade of a slug, his remembrance was knocked
against the corner of his consideration, which capsized
his wisdom out of his Knowledge. His ability was
rocking in the cradle of Lamentation, which was fixed
between joy and sorrow, where Lamentation fell asleep,
and Billy Riley received three dreadful wounds&mdash;both
his elbows were put out of joint, the shin bones of his
knee breeches were transmogrified into a woolpack, and
his stockings were made to rue the day his legs were
born. Billy Gobbles, the dish licker’s son, was accidentally
wounded in different parts, first in his constitution,
and then in his feelings. After which a piece of
plum pudding stuck in the stomach and knocked his appetite
asunder, and the sons of buttermilk were all put
to the rout, and never stopped till they went and rode
the bull, and started off to the land of potatoes, where
buttermilk is sold by the yard&mdash;to plaster their wounds
with potatoes, and the humbugging hospitals of both
nations in Dublin is filled with all the buttermilk sons
that were killed and wounded in this terrible battle of
Pea Soup.</p>

<p>There is one hundred and forty-ten thousand nine
hundred and sixty-twelve pounds reward for whoever
will give the least information of the author of this
battle. The money to be paid down to the informant
by Mr Jack Neverfind, who lives at the top of Toleration
street, three doors below the bottom, near the
corner of Humbug lane, in the days of Tantonybobus,
when Adam will be a young man, three hundred and
sixty-five miles beyond the remembrance of the Antediluvians,
in the reign of our Lord and Sovereign,
Queen Richard, by the grace of Candlesticks, Queen of
Potwollopers, such as velveteen plum puddings, calico
dumplings, and leather apple pies.</p>

<p>It is pretty well known among the circle of his acquaintances, and the townspeople generally, that
Mr &mdash;&mdash;, the old established and highly <i>respectable</i> tradesman of <span class="smcap">THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD</span> is much addicted to
wenching, and that he is known to nearly every boy and girl in the town, big or little, as the “<span class="smcap">Old Ram</span>,” or
“<span class="smcap">Billy Goat</span>.” And it is also well-known that his wife, who is as nice and amiable a little body as ever laid on a
husband’s shirt-tail&mdash;can never keep a maid-servant with a tolerable agreeable face, but he is sure to be in pursuit of
her; and only this year they have had in their service Mary Carter, Jane Baker, Martha Price, Jemima Smith, Harrietta
Johnson, Sarah Tompkins, and Betsy Rogers, all of whom have left at a short notice in consequence of the <i>rumbustiousness</i>
of Mr &mdash;&mdash;. A few weeks ago Mrs &mdash;&mdash; engaged with a very pretty girl named Fanny H&mdash;&mdash;, but
no sooner did “The Old Ram” behold her than he was smitten with her charms, considering her as a domestic
treasure, of which, he flattered himself, he should soon be possessed. Accordingly, Mr &mdash;&mdash; took every opportunity
in the absence of her mistress to say civil things, which so tormented the girl, that she soon gave her mistress
warning. Mrs &mdash;&mdash;, the tradesman’s wife, having taken a great liking to this servant, was very sorry to part
with her, offered to increase her wages, and diminish her labour; but these kind overtures had no effect, the young
woman saying it was impossible for her to stay. This peremptory declaration excited Mrs &mdash;&mdash;’s curiosity to
know what could give the girl so great a disgust of the place, when, upon being interrogated closely upon the
subject, she replied, “Why then, Madam, to tell the truth, my master teazes me so much in your absence that
I have no comfort of my life. I would not mind, continued the girl, if he was a handsome and a young man,
but to be tormented by such <i>an ugly fellow</i> is insupportable.” “An ugly fellow! resumed Mrs &mdash;&mdash;, with great
warmth,&mdash;what, call my husband <i>an ugly fellow</i>? Get out of the house this instant, you jade,”&mdash;then stamping her
foot in great rage, she immediately discharged the girl.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_WONDERFUL" id="THE_WONDERFUL"></a>THE WONDERFUL<br />
Adventures of Mr. O’Flynn in Search<br />
<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
<span class="larger">OLD MOTHER CLIFTON.</span></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Understanding that old Mother Clifton’s house
was blown away 366 miles above the moon, I
went in search of her. I was searching nine days,
running hard as I could with my two shin bones in my
pocket, and my head under my arm, by order of Old
Joe Buck, the Pensioner, who lost his middle eye at the
Battle of Waterloo, chewing half-boiled stirabout.
I then got upon a buck-flea’s back, which carried me
over large hills of skilligalee and bog holes of buttermilk,
till I met Jarvis the coachmaker driving two dead
horses under an empty post-chaise loaded with 18
milliners, 2 tambour workers, 5 loads of apples, a
roasted milestone, and half-a-dozen grenadier cock
magpies, belonging to the French flying artillery,
drinking tea till they were black in the face. I asked
Mr Jarvis did he get any account of the Old Woman
of Ratcliffe Highway, who was drowned in a shower of
feathers last night about three weeks ago, and he told
me he had got no account of her whatever, but if I
went to John Ironsides I’d get some intelligence, and
where John Ironsides lived he told me was two miles
beyond all parts of the parish, up and down a street
where a mad dog bit a hatchet next week, and pigs
wrestle for stirabout: I thanked him for his information
and bid him good night. I than began to run as fast
as I could sit down by the side of a ditch with my two
shin bones and my head in my pocket, till I met a
gentleman with the custom-house of Dublin on his
back, the Manchester exchange in his pocket, and Lord
Nelson’s pillar in London stuck in his eye for a walking-stick.
The Lord help you, poor man, said I, I am
sorry for you, and the devil skewer you, why had you
no better luck? I asked him what was the matter, and
he told me he was bad with the gravel in his eye, the
daddy grumble in his guts, and the worm cholic in his
toe. I then put him into a coach and drove him into a
druggist’s shop and ordered him two pennyworth of
pigeon’s milk, three ounces of the blood of a grasshopper,
a pint of self basting, the head and pluck of a buck
flea, the ribs of a roasted chew of tobacco, and the
lights and liver of a cobbler’s lapstone, boiled separately
altogether in a leather iron pot.</p>

<p>Immediately after taking the mixture he was delivered
of a pair of blacksmith’s bellows, and a small
tomb-stone only a ton weight. Then proceeding on to
Johnny Gooal’s house, said I to him, John, did you get
any account of Mother Clifton’s house, that was blown
366 miles above the moon by a gale of wind from a sow
gelder’s horn. I got no account, says Johnny, only I
wrote a letter to her to-morrow night, when I was
snoring fast asleep with my eyes open, knowing her
father to be a smith and farrier to a pack of wild geese,
and her mother nurse to a nest of young monkies that
was held in the said parish of Up-and-down, where pigs
wrestle for stirabout; but John told me I should not go
till I had dined with them; we then sat down, and
what should be brought up but a dish of stewed paving
stones,, well mixed with tho oil and ribs of a chew of
tobacco, and two quarts of the blood of a lamplighter’s
snuff-box. The next great wonder she showed me, she
brought me into a fine garden and placed me by a cabbage-stalk,
which only covered 52 acres of ground, and
where I saw ten regiments of artillery firing a royal
salute of 21 guns.</p>

<p>The next wonder she showed me was a big man
standing upon a small table made of heath, dressed in a
scarlet black cloak, who made a very great sermon, but
a north country buck flea bit him in the pole of the
neck, and made him roar murder. The next great
wonder I saw was a small boy only a thousand years
old, thrashing tobacco into peas, and one of the peas
started through a wall eighteen feet thick, and killed a
dead boy on the other side. Then there was the
London privateer and the Channel royal mail coach in
a desperate engagement; firing boiled oyster shells,
stewed lapstones, and roasted wigs one at the other, one
of the lapstones struck Mother Clifton over the right
eye and delivered her of the old woman of Ratcliffe
Highway, who was sister to Mother Clifton, who had
nine rows of bees-wax teeth and a three cocked hat
made of the right side of a crab’s nostril. I then took
the Old Hag and made a short leap from Liverpool to
Naas in the North of Ireland, where I saw a French
frigate coming with Nelson’s monument on the top of
her mainmast. So now to bring my story to an end
this Old Woman and me stepped out of the vessel into
the port-hole; I made my escape, but the Old Woman
was always tipsy with drinking Chandler’s tobacco, so
she sunk to the bottom, and if you go there you will
find her making straw hats of deal boards.</p>

IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD&mdash;MRS. YOU-KNOW-WHO.</h3>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Come all you lads and lasses gay, and banish care and strife,&mdash;In the market-place,
a mason did by auction sell his wife;&mdash;Thirteen shillings and a penny for the
lady was the sum,&mdash;And to see the curious spree, some thousands soon did run;&mdash;In the
market-place, I do declare, it’s true upon my life,&mdash;A mason did the other day, by
auction sell his wife. This man and wife, good lack-a-day, did often disagree;&mdash;For
she often pawned her husband’s clothes to go upon the spree. So he led her to
the market, with a halter, I am told,&mdash;And there she was, so help my Bob, by public
auction sold. When the auctioneer began the sale, a jolly farmer cried,&mdash;Here’s
five and fourpence half-penny for the mason’s lushy bride; a tanner cried out
seven and six, and then a butcher said,&mdash;I’ll give you ten and sevenpence, besides a
bullock’s head. She’s going, cried the auctioneer, she’s going, upon my life;&mdash;Tinkers,
coblers, sailors, will you buy a charming wife? Such fighting, scratching,
tearing too, before no one did see;&mdash;Such roaring, bawling, swearing, O! blow me, it
was a spree. At length a rum old cobler did give a dreadful bawl,&mdash;Here’s thirteen
and a penny, with my lapstone and my awl. Thirteen and a penny, when down the
hammer dropt,&mdash;With whiskers, apron, bustle, shawl, stays, petticoat, and&mdash;&mdash;A
lushy mason’s lady was this blooming damsel gay,&mdash;She did unto the hammer come
upon a market day;&mdash;Bakers, butchers, masons, did bid for her, we hear,&mdash;While a
lot of rum old women pitched into the auctioneer. Young men and maids did halloa,
while married folks did sneer, They frightened the old cobler and knocked down the
auctioneer. The cobler took the lady up just like a Scotchman’s pack, and the funny
mason’s lady rode upon the cobler’s back. Some laughed till they bursted, while
others were perplexed, But the cobler bristled up his wife with two big balls of wax;
The cobler sat her on his knee, and joyfully did bawl,&mdash;While the lady knocked about
the seat the lapstone and the awl. Then the mason he did sell his wife, as you shall
understand, And thirteen and a penny was popt into his hand; he whistled and
capered, for to banish care and strife,&mdash;He went into a gin-shop, singing, I have sold
my wife; So the divorced mason he may go, to banish care and strife,&mdash;Unto the
market place again and buy another wife. Now the cobler and the lady are both in a
stall, While the cobler works the bristle, and the lady works the awl. And they
upon the lapstone do so merry play together,&mdash;Singing, heel and toe, gee up, gee woe,
big balls of wax and leather. And day and night in sweet delight, they banish care
and strife,&mdash;the merry little cobler and his thirteen-shilling wife.</p>

<p>Showing how one Richard Middleton was taken before the Mayor of the City he was in, for using cards in
church during divine service; being a droll, merry, and humourous account of an odd affair that happened to a
private soldier in the 6th Regiment of Foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/img077.jpg" width="361" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The sergeant commanded his party
to the church, and when the parson
had ended his prayer, he took his
text; and all them that had a Bible
pulled it out to find the text, but this
soldier had neither Bible, Almanack,
nor Common Prayer book; but he
put his hand in his pocket and pulled
out a pack of cards, and spread them
before him as he sat. While the
parson was preaching, he first kept
looking at one card and then at
another. The sergeant of the company
saw him, and said, “Richard,
put up your cards; for this is no
place for them.” “Never mind that,”
for you have no
business with me here.”</p>

<p>“When the parson had ended his
sermon, and all was over, the soldiers
repaired to the church-yard, and the
commanding officer gave the word of
command to fall in, which they did.
The sergeant of the city came and took
the man prisoner. “Man, you are
my prisoner,” said he. “Sir,” said
the soldier, “What have I done that
I am your prisoner?” “You have
played a game of cards in the church.”
“No,” said the soldier, “I have not
play’d a game, for I only look’d at
a pack.” “No matter for that, you are
my prisoner.” “Where must we go,”
said the soldier? “You must go before
the mayor,” said the serjeant.</p>

<p>So he took him before the mayor;
and when they came to the mayor’s
house, he was at dinner. When he
had dined, he came to them and said&mdash;“well
serjeant, what do you want
with me?” “I have brought a soldier
before your honour, for playing at
cards in the church.” “What! that
soldier.” “Yes.” “Well, soldier,
what have you to say for yourself?”
“Much sir, I hope.” “Well and
good, but if you have not you shall be
punished the worst that ever man was.”
“Sir,” said the soldier, “I have
been five weeks upon the march, and
have but little to subsist on, and am
without either Bible, Almanack, or
Common Prayer book, or anything
but a pack of cards. I hope to satisfy
your honor of the purity of my intention.”</p>

<p>Then the soldier pulled out of his
pocket the pack of cards, which he
spread before the mayor, and then
began with the ace.</p>

<p>“When I see the ace,” said he,
“it puts me in mind that there is one
God only; and when I see the deuce,
it puts me in mind of the Father and
the Son; when I see the tray, it puts
me in mind of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost; When I see the four,
it puts me in mind of the four Evangelists
that preached the gospel, viz.,
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John;
when I see the five, it puts me in
mind of the five wise virgins that
trimmed their lamps; there were
ten, but five were foolish, who were
shut out; when I see the six, it puts me in mind that in six
days the Lord made Heaven and Earth; when I see the seven, it
puts me in mind that the seventh day God rested from all the works
which he had created and made, wherefore the Lord blessed the
seventh day and hallowed it; when I see the eight, it puts me in
mind of the eight righteous persons that were saved when God
drowned the world, viz., Noah, his wife, three sons, and their wives;
when I see the nine, it puts me in mind of nine lepers that were
cleansed by our Saviour, there were ten, but nine never returned
God thanks; when I see the ten, it puts me in mind of the ten
commandments that God gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the two
two tables of stone.</p>

<p>Here he took the knave and laid it aside.</p>

<p>“When I see the queen, it puts me in mind of the queen of
Sheba, who came from the furthermost parts of the world to hear
the wisdom of King Soloman, and who was as wise a woman as he
was a man; for she brought fifty boys and fifty girls, all clothed in
boys’ apparel, to show before King Solomon, for him to tell which
were boys and which were girls; but he could not until he called
for water for them to wash themselves; the girls washed up to their
elbows, and the boys only up to their wrists, so King Solomon told
by that. And also of Queen Victoria&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Queen</span> of <i>our</i>
<span class="smcap">Hearts</span>&mdash;to pray for her. And when I see the King, it puts
me in mind of the great King of heaven and earth, which is God
Almighty.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the mayor, “you have given a very good description
of all the cards except one, which is lacking.” “Which is
that?” said the soldier. “The Knave,” said the mayor. “Oh, I
can give your honour a good description of that, if your honour won’t
be angry. “No, I will not,” says the mayor, “if you will not
term me the knave.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the soldier, “the greatest that I know of is the
serjeant of the city that brought me here.” “I don’t know,” said
the mayor, “that he is the greatest knave, but I am sure he is the
greatest fool.”</p>

<p>“I shall now show your honour how I use the cards as an
Almanack.” “You certainly are a clever fellow,” said the mayor,
“but I think you will have a hard matter to make that appear.”</p>

<p>“When I count how many spots there are in a pack of cards, I
find there are three hundred and sixty-five, there are so many days
in the year.”</p>

<p>“Stop,” said the mayor, “that’s a mistake.” “I grant it,”
said the soldier, “but as I have never yet seen an almanack that
was thoroughly correct in all points, it would have been impossible
for me to imitate an almanack exactly, without, a mistake.” “Your
observations are very correct,” said the mayor; “go on.” When
I count how many cards there are in a pack, I find there are fifty-two;
there are so many weeks in the year; when I count how
many tricks there are in a pack, I find there are thirteen: there
are so many lunar months in the year; there are four suits in the pack,
which represent the four seasons of the year. You see, sir, that
this pack of cards is a Bible, Almanack, Common Prayer book, and
Pack of Cards to me.”</p>

<p>Then the mayor called for a loaf of bread, a piece of cheese, and
a pot of good beer, and gave to the soldier a piece of money, bidding
him to go about his business, saying he was the cleverest man he
had ever seen.</p>

<p>A Famous Fish Factor Found himself
Father of Five Fine Flirting Females, Fanny,
Florence, Fernanda, Francesca, and Fenella.
The First Four were Flattering, Flat Featured,
Forbidden Faced, Freckled Frumps;
Fretful, Flippant, Foolish, and Full of Fun.
The Fisher Failed, and was Forced by Fickle
Fortune to Forego his Footman, Forfeit his
Forefather’s Fine Fields, and Find a Forlorn
Farmhouse in a Forsaken Forest. The Four
Fretful Females, Fond of Figuring at Feasts
in Feathers and Fashionable Finery, Fumed
at their Fugitive Father, Forsaken by Fulsome,
Flattering Fortune hunters, who
Followed them when Fish Flourished. Fenella
Fondled her Father, Flavoured their
Food, Forgot her Flattering Followers, and
Frolickled in Frieze without Flounces. The
Father, Finding himself Forced to Forage
in Foreign parts For a Fortune, Found he
could afford a Fairing to his Five Fondlings.
The First Four were Fain to Foster their
Frivolity with Fine Frills and Fans, Fit to
Finish their Father’s Finances. Fenella,
Fearful of Flooring him, Formed a Fancy
For a Full Fresh Flower. Fate Favoured
the Fish Factor For a Few days, when he Fell
in with a Fog. His Faithful Filly’s Footsteps
Faltered, and Food Failed. He Found himself
in Front of a Fortified Fortress. Finding
it Forsaken, and Feeling himself Feeble
and Forlorn, with Feasting, he Fed upon the
Fish, Flesh, and Fowl he Found, Fricasseed
and Fried, and when Full, Fell Flat on his
Face on the Floor. Fresh in the Forenoon
he Forthwith Flew to the Fruitful Fields,
and not Forgetting Fenella, he Filched a
Fair Flower, when a Foul, Frightful, Fiendish
Figure Flashed Forth. “Felonious
Feller, Fingering my Flower, I’ll Finish
you! Go! Say Farewell to your Fine
Felicitious Family, and Face me in a Fortnight!”
The Faint-hearted Fisher Fumed
and Faltered, and Fast was Far in his Flight.
His Five daughters Flew to Fall at his Feet,
and Fervently Felicitate him. Frantically
and Fluently he unfolded his Fate; Fenella,
Forthwith Fortified by Filial Fondness,
Followed her Father’s Footsteps, and Flung
her Faultless Form at the Foot of the Frightful
Figure, who Forgave the Father, and Fell
Flat on his Face; For he had Fervently
Fallen in a Fiery Fit of love For the Fair
Fenella. He Feasted and Fostered her, till
Fascinated by his Faithfulness, she Forgot
the Ferocity of his Face, Form, and Feature,
and Finally, Frankly, and Fondly Fixed
Friday, the Fifth day of February For the
affair to come off. There were present at
the wedding, Fanny, Florence, Fernanda,
Francesca, and the Fisher; there was Festivity,
Fragrance, Finery, Fireworks, Fricaseed
Frogs, Fritters, Fish, Flesh, Fowls,
and Furmity, Frontinac, Flip, and Fare, Fit
For the Fastidious, Fruit, Fuss, Flambeaux,
and Flowers, Four Fat Fiddlers and Fifers,
and the Frightful Form of the Fortunate
and Frumpish Fiend Fell From him, and he
Fell at Fenella’s Feet, a Fair Favoured, Fine,
Frank Freeman of the Forest. Behold the
Fruits of Filial affection!!</p>

<p>Let the lady, on some occasions, appear devotedly attached, and unusually fond, particularly
at parting in the evening.&mdash;The next day, let her meet her lover with a frown of hatred, and
repulse his advances with a look of ineffable scorn. If he dare to demand a reason for such
conduct on her part (which he will hardly venture to do for some hours), let the reply be, “I am
surprised, sir, YOU should think of addressing me, after what has past. Oh! I never!” This
will SETTLE him for the rest of the day, during which time you can throw in a variety of sly
HINTS, to make him COMFORTABLE, and cause him to wish that he had never been born. At
parting, hold out your hand to him, coolly, and say, “Farewell, cruel man!” but deign no
further favor. The next morning, if he call on you&mdash;which he certainly will,&mdash;relax somewhat of your austerity&mdash;burst
out into tears, and throw yourself into his arms, sobbing as if your heart would break. This will produce a
fine effect! He will accuse himself, inwardly, of a thousand faults he never committed, and acknowledge them for
the sake of forgiveness, which you must gradually bestow.</p>

<p>Another very delightful method of teasing a man if he is very fond of you, is to propose taking a walk with
some friends, and then after making yourself look “provokingly handsome,” accompany him to the door and then,
apparently without design, take the arm of some gentleman of the party, then on your return, say, “I was so
delighted with my walk! I did so enjoy myself; did not you, DEAR?” Repeat these and other doses during courtship,
and if you be skilful you make him fit for a husband, and he will ever let you have your own way and do what
you please.</p>

<div class="verse">Oh, black Monday morning dread I’m sure,</div>
<div class="verse">The landlord is coming, he’s just at the door;</div>
<div class="verse">With his book in his hand he seems fully bent</div>
<div class="verse">To have from his tenants the whole of his rent.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, Mrs. Longface, have you got any
rent ready&mdash;let me see, there’s 5s. on the
book, and 3s. this week makes 8s., now I
have brought a receipt for the whole.&mdash;I am
very sorry, sir, but I have no money till
next week!&mdash;Next week! why your husband
was drunk last Saturday night, and he earns
50s. a week, and can’t pay 3s, this won’t do;
If I can’t get my rent I shall bring the
bailiff on Monday morning, so I tell you
what you have to trust to.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry smaller">
<div class="verse">So away then he goes, and with a black look,</div>
<div class="verse">And under his arm he puts his rent book;</div>
<div class="verse">He knocks at the next door, and his looks are so sour,</div>
<div class="verse">He will turn all the milk in the town in an hour.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Paywell, have you got any
rent for me?&mdash;Yes, sir.&mdash;You are the best
tenant I have got; let me see, 20s., here’s
your receipt.&mdash;Stop, sir, before I pay you
this money, you must send a bricklayer and
a carpenter; there’s the top of the house
wants repairing, the stairs are all to pieces,
and the privy door is off, and I am desired
by my husband not to pay you a farthing
till you have put the whole in complete
repair.&mdash;No. I won’t repair it at all, so if
you don’t like it leave it.&mdash;Yes, but I am
not agoing to give you 20s. When it rained
the other night we were obliged to get up,
and move the children into the middle of the
room, and my husband and I were compelled
to keep up all night with an umbrella over
our heads to keep the rain off. I think if
landlords were as fond of sending carpenters
and bricklayers as they are of sending bailiffs,
it would be more to their advantage.&mdash;But,
Mrs Paywell, where’s your husband, I must
speak to him about it.&mdash;Why, he’s at work,
and he can’t afford to lose a day to wait on
you, so as soon as you get the repairs done
here’s your money.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry smaller">
<div class="verse">Away then he goes, for he’s quite in the dumps,</div>
<div class="verse">And at the next door he gives some hard thumps;</div>
<div class="verse">But on looking up you’d have thought he’d have swooned,</div>
<div class="verse">For his tenants were gone by the light of the moon.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, I’ll call on Mother Lushy. Well,
my little girl, is your mother at home?&mdash;No,
sir, she popped out as you popped in.&mdash;Has
she left any rent for me?&mdash;Yes, sir, she
has left 9d. in the teacup on the mantlepiece.&mdash;What,
9d. out of two months. Why your
mother must think I’m a fool.&mdash;No, sir,
mother says you’re an old rogue.&mdash;Well, tell
her I shall send the broker.&mdash;She says you
have broke her of the last 9d. she had.&mdash;Has
your mother left any money in the teapot?&mdash;No,
sir, there’s only a quartern of gin
in it that mother was going to drink, but she
went out in a hurry.&mdash;Ah, I suppose she
knew I was coming.&mdash;Yes, Mrs. Longface
told her the old rogue of a landlord was coming.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry smaller">
<div class="verse">You see how the tenants the landlords abuse,</div>
<div class="verse">If you ask for your rent you’re sure to get abuse;</div>
<div class="verse">They’ll pester your brains about lots of repairs,</div>
<div class="verse">But who pays the rent, there is nobody cares.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, Mrs Meek, have you got my rent
ready this morning. Let me see, two weeks is
8s., and I’ll write you a receipt.&mdash;Sir, I am
sorry, extremely sorry, very sorry, indeed,
sir, but&mdash;if&mdash;Oh! hang your ifs and your
buts, I suppose you mean to say that you
have got no money for me?&mdash;No, sir, you
seem quite out of temper this morning.&mdash;Temper!
enough to make any man out of
temper. I’ve been to a dozen houses, and
can’t get no money. If I can’t get the rent
next Monday I shall put a bailiff in and sell
all off.&mdash;Stop! sir, stop, not quite so fast
about selling; I am an old woman and can
tell you a little about these houses, yes, I
have lived many years in this neighbourhood,
and can tell you that they are not yours at
all.&mdash;Not mine! bless my soul the woman’s
mad.&mdash;Not so mad as you may imagine, for
I’ll tell you, your father was errand boy to
old Mr Neasy. When he grew up he suffered
him to gather his rents. To make long and
short of the story, old Neasy and his wife
died, and the son being abroad, your father
claimed the houses, but I&mdash;Stop! stop! I
don’t want to hear any more, but come over
the way and have a drop of gin, and I’ll
cross out the 8s. and you shall live rent free;
but don’t say a word to the other tenants.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry smaller">
<div class="verse">So home he goes and thumps down his book,</div>
<div class="verse">Makes his wife and his children begin for to look;</div>
<div class="verse">Confound all the houses, they all shall be sold,</div>
<div class="verse">And the old bricks and mortar I’ll turn into gold.</div>

<p>While MEN spare no pains in obtaining the BEST MATERIALS for this superlative
DISH, they are often totally regardless after the first MOUTHFUL, of the necessary
precautions to render it permanently SWEET, and if through neglect it turn sour they
invariably slander the Dish, while the fault is in themselves. To MAKE the wife a
sweet companion, but to keep her so, this may be accomplished in the following manner:&mdash;Obtain
an adequate supply of the pure water of affection, and gently immerse her
therein: should the water during this process become ruffled, a little of the original
balm of courtship will soon restore it to its usual smoothness. The fire should be
composed of true love, with a few sighs to increase the flame, which should not be
too warm, nor yet suffered to abate entirely, as that would spoil the dish. Coolness
is often the ruin of this dish, erroneously asserted by some cooks to be necessary,
which cooks add also sprigs of indifference, but this is a very dangerous practice, as
a good wife is exquisitely delicate and susceptible. A few evergreens, such as industry,
sobriety, and fondness, are necessary, and a moderate quantity of the spirit
of coaxing and oil of kisses may be added, giving the whole a most delectable
flavour. Garnish with flowers of endearment and kindness, and you will then fully
appreciate the delights of a dish, compared with which all others sink into insignicance;

<span class="smaller">OR</span><br />
The Last of the “Cocks,” or “Catchpennies.”</h3>

<p>When at Brighton in the month of August, 1869, and winding our way through a maze of small streets
laying between Richmond and Albion Hills, in the northern part of the town, our ears voluntarily “pricked up”
on hearing the old familiar sounds of a “street, or running patterer” with the stereotyped sentences of “Horrible,”&mdash;“Dreadful,”&mdash;“Remarkable
letters found on his person,”&mdash;“Cut down by a labouring man,”&mdash;“Quite dead,”&mdash;“Well-known
in the town,”&mdash;“Hanging,”&mdash;“Coroner’s Inquest,”&mdash;“Verdict,”&mdash;“Full particulars,”&mdash;“Most
determined suicide,”&mdash;“Brutal conduct,” &amp;c., &amp;c., <i>only a ha’penny! Only a ha’penny!</i> Presently we saw the man
turn into a wide court-like place, which was designated by the high-sounding name of “<span class="smcap">Square</span>,” and dedicated to
<span class="smcap">Richmond</span>; hither we followed him, and heard him repeat the same detached sentences, and became a purchaser for
<i>only a ha’penny!</i> when to our astonishment we discovered a somewhat new phase in “Cock” selling, inasmuch as
our purchase consisted of the current number (253) of the <i>Brighton Daily News</i>&mdash;a very respectable looking and

most determined suicide.</p>

<p>Being at the time engaged in arranging the materials for <span class="smcap">The Literature of the Streets</span>, we ventured upon
a conversation with the “street patterer” in the following form: “Well, governor, <i>how does the cock fight</i>?”
“Oh, pretty well, sir; but it ain’t a ‘cock,’ it’s a genuine thing&mdash;the days of cocks is gone bye&mdash;cheap newspapers
’as done ’em up.” “Yes; we see this is a Brighton newspaper of to-day.” “Oh, yes, that’s right enough&mdash;but it’s
all true.” “Yes; we are aware of that; but you are vending them after the old form.” “That’s all right enough&mdash;you
see, sir, I can sell ’em better in that style than as a newspaper: I’ve sold ten or twelve dozen of ’em to-day.”
“Yes; but how about them to-morrow?” “Oh, then it will be all bottled-up&mdash;and I must look for a new game.
I’m on my way to London, but hearing of this suicide job, I thought I’d work ’em.” To our question of “Have
you got any old <i>real</i> ‘cocks’ by you?” he replied, “No, not a bit of a one; I’ve worked ’em for a good many years,
but it ain’t no go now. Oh, yes, I know’d ‘Old Jemmy Catnach’ fast enough&mdash;bought many hundreds, if not
thousands of quires of him.&mdash;Not old enough? Oh, ain’t I though; why I’m turned fifty, and I’ve been a ‘street
paper’ seller nearly all my life. I knows Muster Fortey too very well; him as is got the business now in the Dials&mdash;he
knows his way about, let him alone for that.” Having rewarded the man with a few half-pence to make him
some recompense for having detained him during his business progress, we parted.</p>

<p>On a perusal of the newspaper “Particulars” of the case, of which we subjoin a condensed copy, it will
be found to contain all the necessary material for a clever and experienced “Patterer” to work upon, and that&mdash;</p>

<h4>The Determined Suicide of an Aged Artist.<br />
REMARKABLE LETTERS OF THE DECEASED.</h4>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yesterday, at noon, an inquest was opened at the
Race Hill Inn, Lewes Road, before J. A. Freeman, Esq.
(deputy coroner), and a highly respectable jury, on the
body of Mr. John Baldey, an aged artist, who committed
suicide in a most determined manner early on the morning
of the previous day. During the inquiry, which
was a lengthy one, some remarkable letters, proved to
be in the handwriting of the deceased, were read. They
were written in a clear, and rather bold round hand, the
caligraphy particularly, for so old a man, being exceptionally
good.</p>

<p>John Salter said&mdash;I am a labourer; yesterday morning
about twenty minutes to six o’clock, I was going to
my work to the building, I saw a man hanging, and
that made me go in. The house is unfinished, and is
at the corner of Park Crescent Road and Upper Lewes
Road. I found the deceased hanging from one of the
joists in the back room on the ground floor. I did not
know the deceased. I at once cut him down. His feet
were about 18 inches from the ground. There was a
ladder close to his left hand. When I cut him down he
was quite dead; he appeared to have been dead for
hours. There was a man passing at the time, and, as I
was going into the house, I called to him to assist me.
He helped me with the deceased, and I afterwards went
for a policeman.</p>

<p>John Baunister said&mdash;About ten minutes past nine
o’clock on Monday evening I saw the deceased come
out of Park Crescent and go into the unfinished house
at the corner of Park Crescent. There was nothing
particular about the deceased to attract my attention. I
did not see the deceased come out of the house again
that evening. The next time I saw the deceased was
about ten minutes to six o’clock on Tuesday morning.
I saw him lying on the ground in the unfinished house
into which I had seen him go the previous night. That
was after he was cut down. He was quite dead.</p>

<p>Mrs Ann Colwell said&mdash;The deceased lodged at my
house. He had lodged with me about five years. He was
about seventy years of age. I last saw him alive on
Monday afternoon about half-past four o’clock. I spoke
to him, and he seemed about as usual. During the last
three weeks or a month he had complained to me of his
circumstances, and told me he must get cheaper lodgings.
Generally, he was of a cheerful disposition. I
did not notice any particular change in his manner except
that he occasionally sighed. In consequence of
what he said I let him have his lodgings a shilling a
week cheaper. He was an artist, and used to go out to
sell his water-colour drawings. Last week he went out
for that purpose, and when he came he said it was of no
use, but that he would have one more trial to sell his
pictures, and when he returned he said he had done no
good. One lady had promised to come and look at his
pictures. He suffered from chronic affection, which
caused him acute pain. His last attack was about a
week ago. He had been an invalid for a long time.
The affection under which he laboured disturbed his
rest. He was desponding about his future&mdash;his general
conversation led me to think that he very much feared
poverty, but on the whole he was a taciturn man. I
did not think he was more desponding during the last
week than he had been previously. He did not tell me
much about his affairs, but I understood some small
source of income had recently ceased. Last Saturday
he brought in two eggs for his dinner, and he provided
nothing for Sunday. That was unusual. I asked him
on Sunday morning what he was going to have for dinner,
and he said he only wanted a knife and fork. I
think he had a small pie for dinner, but I don’t know.
There was a bag on the table containing 6d.&mdash;that was
all the money that has been found. Two of the letters
produced were found on the mantel-piece&mdash;they are in
the handwriting of the deceased.</p>

<p>The Coroner read the letters. The first was addressed
to his brother, and was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You will regret dear Charles my untimely end. I have not the
heart to say more than love to all. Your affectionate brother
<span class="smcap">John</span>.”</p>

<p>“You will find in the deal box my rent book&mdash;2 weeks rent is
due, a trifle to the laundress, and 10s. on Mr. Verrall’s acc’t&mdash;that is
all I owe.”</p></div>

<p>The second letter was in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="sig1">“16 St. George’s St</p>

<p class="right">“Augt 23&mdash;1869.</p>

<p class="noindent">“to the humane,</p>

<p>“let my body be taken direct to the receiving house of the
parochial cemetery I wish to be placed in the earth at the least possible
expense and inconvenience at the inquest this writing will shew
that I caused my own death, being, at the same time quite serene
and composed. I wish my remains to be placed in a deal coffin,
and when the darkness of night has closed in to be intered (<i>sic</i>) in
the catholic burial ground the catholics are larger and warmer
hearted than protestants, I trust and hope these my wishes may be
conceded and fulfill’d</p>

<p class="sig1">“<span class="smcap">John Baldey</span></p>

<p class="right">“aged 70 years 37 days.”</p></div>

<p>In answer to further questions,</p>

<p>Mrs. Colwell said&mdash;I don’t think the deceased went
to any place of worship. He was not a drinking man&mdash;he
never drank to any excess.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Hamilton Brown Ross, retired surgeon-major
in the Indian army, said&mdash;I live at 149, Upper Lewes
Road. Yesterday morning, soon after six o’clock, I was
called by a policeman. I dressed as quickly as possible
and came to this house. I found the deceased in one
of the lower rooms, and from the appearance and temperature
of the body&mdash;the coldness of the body and
limbs, and the general surface, and the surface mark
round the neck, and the ecchymosis or extravasation of
blood round the mark, and the parchment-like appearance
of his shrivelled skin, the cadaverous rigidity of
the limbs and neck, usually denominated <i>rigor mortis</i>, I
am decidedly of opinion the man must have been dead
six hours or more. The expression of countenance was
haggard and depressed in the extreme&mdash;it had altogether
a worn and wretched appearance. The characteristics
of hanging were so strongly marked, so apparent, that I
considered a <i>post mortem</i> examination perfectly unnecessary,
and the more so as the morbid appearances of the
brain had been so much modified by the long period the
body had been suspended, that any indications of congestion,
or other brain disease, would have been merged
in those produced by hanging so long. I have heard the
evidence hitherto given, and the letters read, and I say
this,&mdash;that, although nothing could be more deliberate
and determined than the act of suicide, I am of opinion
that his mind was so overcharged and thrown off its
balance by the dread of approaching inevitable poverty,
that he was driven in a moment of despair to put an end
to his existence; and, therefore taking all these things
into consideration, I am further of opinion that he committed
the deed while labouring under an attack of
suicidal monomania. I think that suicidal monomania
is consistent with his having written the letters which
have been read, for it is a peculiarity of that disease to
be quite sane on all other points.</p>

<p>P.C. Bassett said&mdash;I was called to the deceased, and
found him lying on the ground in the unfinished house.
He was quite dead. Part of the rope I produce was
round his neck. I searched the body then and there,
and found in the left-hand coat pocket the letter I produce.
It is addressed to Mrs. Colwell.</p>

<p>The Coroner read the letter, which was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“Mrs. Colwell,</p>

<p class="indent4em">“Dear Madam,</p>

<p>“I have long felt should I outlive my means and be reduced to
want&mdash;I could not have the heart or know how to plead poverty,
that state of things has come to pass, with my health and strength
utterly prostrate my heart sinks with despair, as I am unworthy and
but little known. I feel I have no claim on society or to be supported
by others, the thought of the future has heavily overcome
me. I end my days rashly and sadly, do not censure me, but make
allowance for the frailties of human nature, consider it to be an act
of weakness and want of manly fortitude.&mdash;Your’s truly with best
wishes.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">John Baldey.</span></p>

<p>“August 23, 1869.”</p></div>

<p>P.C. Bassett further said&mdash;In the right-hand waistcoat
pocket I found the small bag produced. I
afterwards removed the body to this house.</p>

<p>Superintendent Crowhurst said&mdash;I had known the
deceased a good many years&mdash;by name and by sight. I
knew Dr. Baldey, the brother of the deceased, who
lived in Bartholomews, and was a parish doctor twenty-four
or twenty-five years ago. He committed suicide
by taking prussic acid. There was no inquest, but an
inquiry by the police.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Baldey said&mdash;I am a grocer, and live in
Chichester Place, Kemp Town. The deceased was my
brother, and was seventy years of age. I last saw him
alive last Wednesday. He came up to my house and
dined with me. He appeared rather low, and complained
that nothing had passed through him for a long
time past, and he suffered great pain in consequence;
and that he must go to the doctor. That morning, at
three o’clock, he had suffered extremely. I asked him
whether he would take any ale. He said he dared not&mdash;he
had not taken any for two years. He had about
half a glass of gin. He received a sum of £10 about
a couple of months ago. He sold a reversion three or
four years ago for about £150 or £170. We&mdash;my
brother and myself&mdash;knew he was in poor circumstances,
and intended to provide for him. We were only waiting
for him to come to us. Nothing had ever directly
passed between the deceased and myself as to his
poverty. He was a man of few words, but very excitable,
and we were obliged to be careful what we said to
him. He had not been to my house previous to Wednesday
since Christmas. I remember my brother, Dr.
Baldey&mdash;it is true he committed suicide about twenty-four
years ago. I don’t know what religion my brother
was, for I have seen so little of him, but we are not a
Roman Catholic family.</p>

<p>The Deputy-Coroner shortly left the case to the jury,
who, after consideration, found that the deceased destroyed
himself while suffering from “suicidal monomania.”&mdash;<i>Brighton

<hr class="r15" />

<p>To “work a litany” in the streets is considered one of the higher exercises of professional skill on the part of the patterer. In
working this, a clever patterer&mdash;who will not scruple to introduce anything out of his head which may strike him as suitable to his
audience&mdash;is very particular in his choice of a mate, frequently changing his ordinary partner, who may be good “at a noise” or a ballad,
but not have sufficient acuteness or intelligence to patter politics as if he understood what he was speaking about. I am told that there are
not twelve patterers in London whom a critical professor of street elocution will admit to be capable of “working a catechism” or a
litany. “Why, sir,” said one patterer, “I’ve gone out with a mate to work a litany, and he’s humped it in no time.” To ‘hump,’ in
street parlance, is equivalent to ‘botch,’ in more genteel colloquialism. “And when a thing’s humped,” my informant continued, “you
can only ‘call a go.’” To ‘call a go,’ signifies to remove to another spot, or adopt some other patter, or, in short, to resort to some
change or other in consequence of a failure.</p>

<p>The street-papers in the dialogue form have not been copied nor derived from popular productions&mdash;but even in the case of Political
Litanies and Anti-Corn-law Catechisms and Dialogues are the work of street authors.</p>

<p>One intelligent man told me, that properly to work a political litany, which referred to ecclesiastical matters, he “made himself up,”
as well as limited means would permit, as a bishop! and “did stunning, until he was afraid of being stunned on skilly.”&mdash;<i>Henry Mayhew’s
London Labour and the London Poor.</i></p>

<img class="wordpicture" src="images/the-queen.jpg" width="315" height="40" alt="THE QUEEN" /><br /><br />
AND PRINCE ALBERT.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/royal-crest-5.jpg" width="200" height="79" alt="" />
</div>

<h4>PARTICULARS.</h4>

<p>About six o’clock on Wednesday evening the Queen
and Prince Albert left Buckingham Palace by the garden
gate opening upon Constitution hill. Her Majesty and
the Prince were seated in a very low German drotschky
followed by the equerries in waiting, Colonel Buckley
and Sir Edward Bowater, and the usual attendants. A
number of respectable people had assembled outside the
gate to witness her departure, and were ranged in two
lines to admit of the carriages passing through. After
the carriage had issued from the gate, and had proceeded
some short distance up Constitution hill, so as to be
quite clear of the crowd, a young man, who it is said
had come from the Green park, and was standing with
his back to the railings, presented a pistol and fired it
directly, either at Her Majesty or Prince Albert, there
being no person between him and the carriage. The
Prince, who, it would seem, had heard the whistling of
the ball, turned his head in the direction from which
the report came, and Her Majesty at the same instant
rose up in the carriage, but Prince Albert as suddenly
pulled her down by his side. The man then drew from
behind his back a second pistol, which he discharged
after the second carriage, which proceeding at the
ordinary pace, had by that time passed him a little.
The reports of both pistols were very loud, and at the
discharge of the second several of the female spectators
screamed loudly. Several persons rushed towards the
perpetrator of this gross outrage, and he was immediately
seized, first by a person having the appearance
of a labouring man, and then by Mr. Beckham, one of
the Queen’s pages, and another bystander, by whom he
was handed over to two of the metropolitan police, who
conveyed him to the Queen square Police Court. By
some it is alleged that the miscreant stood with his arms
folded, apparently waiting for the arrival of the carriage;
others state that he was crouching down, as if endeavouring
to escape observation; and, after firing the
first shot, he changed the second pistol into his right
hand in order to fire it. The discharge of the pistols
and the seizure of the offender scarcely occupied a
minute. Her Majesty’s carriage sustained no delay, and
moved on up Constitution hill at the usual pace, and by
half-past six had arrived at the Duchess of Kent’s Ingestrie-house,
Belgrave-square, where her Majesty
stopped for a short time, but neither her appearance
nor that of Prince Albert evinced any inclination of
alarm or excitement at the deadly attack from which
they had so providentially escaped.</p>

<h4>NAME OF THE MISCREANT.</h4>

<p>The name of the ruffian who has been guilty of this
atrocious attack is Edward Oxford; his address is No. 6,
West-street, West-square, and he is said to be a servant
out of place. His appearance is that of a mechanic,
from 18 to 20 years of age, and rather below the middle
height. We have been informed that on searching him
a list of the names of twenty-six individuals was found,
which he admitted that he had intended to have burnt
or destroyed, and some circumstance has transpired
which leads to a belief that the persons whose names
are contained in the list above-mentioned are in some
way connected with the prisoner for some sinister
purpose. On searching his lodgings a sword was also
found, and some crape arranged for the purpose of being
worn on a hat or cap in such a way as to conceal the
face of the wearer, and the crape is also stated to be
folded in a peculiar manner, so that the crape which
was intended for the prisoner would distinguish him
from the rest of the gang with which it is said he is connected,
and who were to be similarly disguised.</p>

<p>We have also heard that on being taken to the police-station
the following conversation took place:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What are you?&mdash;I have been brought up to the bar.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say as a lawyer?&mdash;No; to the bar,
to draw porter.</p>

<p>“Are you a pot-boy?&mdash;No, I’m above that.</p>

<p>“Are you a publican?&mdash;No, I’m not so high as
that.”</p>

<p>We cannot vouch for the authenticity of this conversation,
but merely give it as it reached us. The
conduct of the prisoner throughout his examination
manifested great self-possession.</p>

<p>The pistols are described as small pistols of Birmingham
manufacture, rather well finished. They were
loaded with balls, one of which struck the wall opposite
to where the prisoner stood, and the other ball is
said to have lodged in one of the trees.</p>

<p>The charge against the prisoner entered on the charge
sheet is&mdash;“With maliciously and unlawfully discharging
two pistols at Her Majesty and Prince Albert on Constitution-hill.”</p>

Queen, we rejoice to say, is, to all appearance, as well
as her subjects can desire, and that the illustrious infant

<p>At five-and-twenty minutes to three a royal salute
from the Tower and other guns announced the joyous

<p>Her Majesty’s marriage, it will be remembered, took
place on Monday, the 10th of February, nine months

<p>The Lord Chancellor was presiding in his Court with
the intention of pronouncing some judgments, but he
instantly locked up his papers and repaired to Buckingham
Palace, as his presence is officially required on
these occasions.</p>

<h3><a name="A_STRANGER_IN_HER_MAJESTYS_BEDROOM" id="A_STRANGER_IN_HER_MAJESTYS_BEDROOM"></a>A STRANGER IN HER MAJESTY’S BEDROOM.</h3>

<p class="center larger">THE BOY JONES AGAIN!</p>

<p class="center">“What will Mrs. Grundy say&mdash;Mrs. Lilley?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Wednesday, shortly after 12 o’clock, the inmates of Buckingham
Palace were aroused by an alarm being given that a
stranger had been discovered under the sofa in her Majesty’s
dressing-room. The domestics and officers of the household were
immediately in motion, and it was soon ascertained that the alarm
was not without foundation. The daring intruder was immediately
secured, and safely handed over to the custody of the police.</p>

<p>The inquiry into this mysterious circumstance has created the
most intense interest at Buckingham Palace and the west-end of the
of the town, where the report spread with the rapidity of lightning.
At first it was not generally believed, but when it was known that
the prisoner was under examination at the Home Office public
curiosity was at its height, and inquiries into the most minute
particulars were made in every place where it was likely to obtain
information respecting an event which might, under present circumstances,
have been attended with most dangerous effects to the
health of our beloved Queen.</p>

<p>Shortly after 12 o’clock one of her Majesty’s pages, attended by
other domestics of the royal household, went into her Majesty’s
dressing-room, which adjoins the bed-chamber in which the Queen’s
accouchement took place. Whilst there they imagined that they
heard a noise. A strict search was commenced, and under the sofa
on which her Majesty had been sitting only about two hours before
they discovered a dirty, ill-looking fellow, who was immediately
dragged from his hiding-place, and given into the custody of
Inspector Stead, then on duty at the Palace. The prisoner immediately
underwent a strict search, but no weapon of any dangerous
nature was found on his person. He was afterwards conveyed to
the station in Gardener’s Lane, and handed over to Inspector
Haining, of the A division of police, with instructions to keep him
in safe custody until he received further orders from the Home
Office. We understand that as soon as the prisoner was handed over
to the police he was immediately recognised as the same person who
effected such an extraordinary entrance into Buckingham Palace
about two years since, for which offence he was tried at the Westminster
Sessions and acquitted, the jury being of opinion that he
was not right in his mind. It may here be stated that the name of
the daring intruder into the abode of royalty is Edward Jones; he
is 17 years of age. In person the prisoner is very short of his age,
and has a most repulsive appearance; he was very meanly dressed,
but affected an air of great consequence; be repeatedly requested
the police to address him in a becoming manner, and to behave
towards him as they ought to do to a gentleman who was anxious
to make a noise in the world.</p>

<p>At 12 o’clock on Thursday the prisoner was brought in
custody of the police to the Home Office, and shortly afterwards
taken before the Council, when, we understand, he was interrogated
as to his motives for such extraordinary conduct, and particularly
as to the mode by which he obtained an entrance into the Palace. He
(the prisoner) told their lordships that he was willing to point out
to the police the way he effected an entrance, and to state all
particulars. Their lordships, on this statement, directed the police
immediately to convey Jones to Buckingham Palace, and obtain the
information he promised to give, and adjourned the inquiry until
half past two o’clock.</p>

<p>The prisoner was taken to the Palace, and brought back again to
the Home Office at two o’clock. At half-past two the Council reassembled,
when we understand the prisoner made the following
extraordinary statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Monday night he scaled the wall of Buckingham Palace
garden, about half-way up Constitution Hill; he then proceeded to
the Palace and effected an entrance through one of the windows.
He had not, however, been there long before he considered it unsafe
for him to stay, as so many people were moving about, and he left
by the same mode as he entered. The next day he again effected
an entrance in the same manner as on the previous night; and he
went on to state that he remained in the Palace the whole of Tuesday
night, the whole day on Wednesday, and up till one o’clock on
Thursday morning, when he was discovered under a sofa in her
Majesty’s dressing-room, as above described. The prisoner pointed
out all the passages and places he had gone through previous to his
arrival at the room in which he was discovered, and there appears
no reason to doubt his statement. The hiding place of the intruder
was first discovered by one of her Majesty’s pages, and when he was
asked what brought him there, he replied, that he wanted to see
what was going forward in the Palace, that he might write about
it, and if he was discovered he should be as well off as Oxford,
who fared better in Bedlam tham he (prisoner) did out of it.
He was also asked if, during the time he was in the Palace, he saw
the Queen or the infant Princess, and he replied that he did not,
but that he had heard a noise, which he thought came from her
Majesty’s room.</p>

<p>Her Majesty’s page, who discovered the prisoner, and the constable
who took him to the station-house, were then examined.</p>

<p>The Council came to the decision that, as no property or dangerous
weapon was found on the prisoner, it would be better to inflict
a summary punishment; and a warrant was accordingly made out,
and signed by Mr. Hall, committing the prisoner to the House of
Correction, Tothill Street, as a rogue and vagabond, for three
months.</p>

<p>The prisoner was immediately afterwards conveyed in a cab to
Tothill Street.</p>

<h4>LATEST PARTICULARS.</h4>

<p>The sensation caused by the late mysterious entrance of the boy
Jones into Buckingham Palace, appears to be even greater than
that produced by his apprehension in the same place in December,
1838. The object which prompted so daring a proceeding is still
involved in the utmost doubt; but it was not probable that it was
his intention to do any personal injury to her Majesty, for had such
been his purpose abundant opportunities of carrying it into effect
presented themselves during his concealment in the chamber where
he was secured. From a well informed source, we have heard the
sofa under which Jones was found is in the ante-room in which the
Princess Royal and Mrs. Lilley, her Royal Highness’s nurse, repose.
On the night in question the latter had not long retired to rest ere
she fancied she heard a noise similar to that likely to be caused by
a person who was endeavouring to prevent his presence from being
discovered, and was moving in a stealthy manner. Mrs. Lilley at
first treated the matter as of no moment, thinking probably that
the noise might have been imaginary. Its renewal, however,
created an alarm, and she instantly summoned those of the
attendants who were on guard in the adjoining ante-chamber. On
their arrival the offender was quickly discovered and drawn from
his place of hiding. The statement then goes on to say that her
Majesty, who but three hours previously had been sitting on this
particular sofa, having been disturbed by the confusion to which the
event had given rise, called out and desired to be informed as to
its cause. As an apprehension was, however, entertained that the
sudden communication of the occurrence might be attended with an
unfavourable effect on her Majesty, the attendants gave an evasive
answer. The Queen repeated her command, and then the fact of
the boy’s concealment and subsequent apprehension were made
known to her.</p>

<p>The circumstances at that time appeared not to produce any very
visible effect on her Majesty, but on Thursday symptoms of other
than a satisfactory character were apparent. It affords us the
highest gratification to be able to add that a few hours of quietude
tended to the restoration of her Majesty.</p>

<p>It would appear that there is now no doubt but that the account
given by Jones as to his having effected his entrance into the Palace
by scaling the garden wall from Constitution Hill is correct. Upon
being asked whether he had not met some of the attendants in the
course of his progress along the corridor and staircase, he replied,
“Yes,” but that, when he saw any one coming in his direction, he
hid himself behind the pillars, or behind any piece of furniture
which happened to be near. Hitherto he has been silent as to the
motive which induced him to take so extraordinary a step as that of
forcing his way a second time into the royal apartments, and when
asked on Friday morning, after he had been upon the tread-wheel,
how he liked his punishment, his answer was to the effect that he
had got into the scrape, and must do the best he could.</p>

<p>There does not appear to be the slightest ground for the rumour
that he is insane.</p>

<p>Many circumstances have transpired to show that Jones was in
the Palace the whole of Wednesday. The delinquent states that
during the day he secreted himself under different beds and in cupboards,
until at last he obtained an entrance into the room in which
he was discovered. Not much reliance can be placed in his statements,
but, as such general curiosity exists on the subject, we may state
that, in answer to interrogatories, he said, “that he had sat
upon the throne, that he saw the Queen, and heard the Princess
Royal cry.”</p>

<p>Prince Albert was in the room with her Majesty taking leave for
the night when the miscreant was discovered under the sofa.</p>

<p>The fellow’s shoes were found in one of the rooms of the
ground-floor. The sofa under which the boy was discovered, we
understand, is one of most costly and magnificent material and
workmanship, and ordered expressly for the accommodation of the
royal and illustrious visitors who call to pay their respects to her
Majesty.</p>

<p>“Buckingham Palace, Tuesday, November 9, 1841,</p>

<p class="indent4em">“Half-past 11 o’clock, a.m.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Locock and Prince Albert, with the nurse, were the only
persons in the Queen’s chamber, situated in the north-west angle of
the palace. The Duchess of Kent and the Lady in Waiting were
in an apartment immediately adjoining, and close to where Sir
James Clark and his medical colleagues were assembled. The
Ministers, Privy Councillors, and Great Officers of State occupied
one of the state rooms. It has been stated that these all wore the
Windsor uniform; such is not the fact; not one of them did so.
The Duke of Wellington wore the dress of Constable of the Tower,
Earl Jersey the official dress of Master of the Horse, the Earl of
Liverpool, Earl Delawarr, and the Marquis of Exeter wore their
household uniforms, and the Ministers their official dresses.</p>

<p>The birth took place at 12 minutes to 11 o’clock, and was duly
announced to the great functionaries of the kingdom assembled by
Sir James Clark, and they were soon afterwards gratified with a
sight of the royal infant.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Wharncliffe, Lord President
of the Council, and Lord Stanley, Secretary of State for the
Colonies, were too late, arriving at the palace a few minutes after
the birth had taken place. It is an error in some of the accounts
which have been published which stated that the Archbishop of
Canterbury was present at the birth. The Bishop of London was
the only prelate present.</p>

<p>The following is the official announcement from the <i>London
Gazette Extraordinary</i>, published early in the afternoon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Buckingham Palace, Nov. 9, 1841.</p>

<p>“This morning, at twelve minutes before eleven, the Queen was
happily delivered of a Prince, his Royal Highness Prince Albert,
her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent, several Lords of Her
Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Council, and the Ladies of Her
Majesty’s Bed-chamber, being present.</p>

<p>“The great and important news was immediately made known
to the town by the firing of the Park and Tower guns; and the
Privy Council being assembled as soon as possible thereupon, at the
Council Chamber, Whitehall, it was ordered that a Form of
Thanksgiving for the Queen’s safe delivery of a Prince be prepared
by his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, to be used in all
churches and chapels throughout England, Wales, and the town of
Berwick-upon-Tweed, on Sunday, the 14th of November, or the
Sunday after the respective ministers shall receive the same.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty and the Infant Prince are, God be praised, both
doing well.”</p></div>

<p>The auspicious event, although daily anticipated for the last
fortnight, has come upon the country with a pleasurable sudden
surprise.</p>

<p>Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent remained with the
Queen throughout the day until six o’clock in the afternoon, when
Her Royal Highness returned to Clarence House.</p>

<p>The nobility and gentry thronged during the afternoon to Buckingham
Palace.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 124px;">
<img src="images/img120.jpg" width="124" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>Crispin.</i> By the lord of the manor,
thou art a tough piece, and not much
unlike the hide of my wife Bridget; for
though I should beat her hide with
all my might and main, I cannot shape
the vixen to my fancy: Oh, you hard
soles (<i>hammering</i>) are the most useless
of all others, except to the wearer. If
I was a leading man in the state, I
should move for a law to be enacted,
that good <i>leather</i> and good <i>hemp</i> should
only be employed for smuggling courtiers,
purse-proud citizens, and for parliament-men&mdash;if
such a law should
pass, it would be a rare thing for trade in general.</p>

<p class="center">Enter <span class="smcap">Pander</span> and <span class="smcap">Sir Bilberry Dibble</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pand.</i> Here’s a psalm-singing cobbler, Sir Bilberry; he has a
vote for the borough, as good as the best; do not let us pass honest
Crispin.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> By the essence of lillies, thou’rt right, Pander; the scum
of mobility, as well as the scum of gentry, at this time, must be
attended to; ’tis a sacrifice that’s due to necessity. Therefore, may
I never more breathe the mellifluous air of Montpellier, if I do
not descend to request his suffrage; the controverted occasion carries
a pardon for the humiliating and filthy condescension.&mdash;Master
Shoe-maker, your most devoted humble servant (<i>bowing</i>), I am,
sweet sir, yours to the ground. (<i>still bowing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> Master Shoe-maker! do you mean to mock me?&mdash;No, no,
I am no shoe-maker, but like some of your very fine gentlemen at
the head of affairs&mdash;a poor cobbler at best.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> This fellow, Pander, has been commended by some blockhead,
like himself for his insufferable bluntness, or he would never
presume to be so shocking to the feelings of delicacy.</p>

<p><i>Pan.</i> Bear with him, Sir Bilberry; this is a time when men will
say whatever comes uppermost, paying no more respect to delicacy
than Æsops’s cock to his diamond. If you would succeed, Sir Bilberry,
you must descend to be perfectly reconciled to their oddities.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> I will be reconciled. Well, honest cobbler.&mdash;Do you love
money?</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> Yes; but I love honesty better&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Honestly said. If you do me a favor, you shall have as
much honesty as you please, and money into the bargain.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> Who are you, and may it please you?</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> I am Sir Bilberry Dibble, knight and baronet, of Dibble
Hall, in this county; come to offer myself for your most ancient
borough of Steady-town; should I be so happy as to obtain the
ultimate zenith of my wish, you, Mr. Cobbler, shall soon find an
alteration in the price of good ale; bread shall be but half the rate
it stands at now; and above all, your trade shall flourish and your
taxes fall; so that the cobbler as well as the prince shall have a
glorious opportunity of saddling his spit with a fat sirloin; your
right of common shall soon be restored, and without excise, or the
doctor’s tithe; pigs, poultry, and plum puddings, shall crown your
cupboards all the year. Now give me your vote, friend Crispin,
and as you puff your fragrant essence from your stall in merry glee,
you heel the shoe, and bless the hour you gave your vote for
Dibble.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> Oh, you fine powdered gentlemen are something like my
codling tree last spring.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> How’s that, cobbler?</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> It then dealt a wonderful show of blossom, so much that I
concluded a rare autumn; but, alas! I was mistaken; I had not so
much as a crump. So ’tis with you who are candidates for boroughs,
you promise very fair in the spring of your canvass, but in autumn
of election, when we should expect the fruit of good works of you,
we too often find you worthless, base, and barren.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Nay, Mr. Cobbler, you are too severe in the conclusions;
a man of my honour can never deceive you;&mdash;Can I, Pander?</p>

<p><i>Pand.</i> No, Sir Bilberry. I have known Sir Bilberry from a
child, and never knew a dishonest thing of him, upon my honour,
friend Crispin.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> That’s the last lie you told, Friend Pander. Well, Sir
Bilberry Dibble, knight and baronet of Dibble-hall, in this county,
you are come to ask a vote of a poor cobbler.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> I am, friend Crispin, and you may assure yourself that
there is not a man in the whole borough I respect so much as yourself,
though but a poor cobbler.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> Indeed!&mdash;that’s strange&mdash;why you never saw me before.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Oh, that don’t signify! I tell you, friend Crispin, I respect
you equal to the mayor himself.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> That’s kind. Come into my stall and sit down, and let’s
have a little chat together; there, that’s hearty; give us your fist.
(<i>Here Dibble takes up his clothes, gets into the cobbler’s stall, and
sits down.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Pshaw! how he stinks. (<i>aside.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> So you love me as well as the lord of the manor himself?&mdash;that’s
kind, and so we’ll have a glass of gin together.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Oh, no! ’pon honour.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> Oh, yes; when this is gone, there’s enough at the Three
Norfolk Dumplins and Horse Shoe over the way! Come, here’s
the North-country cobbler’s health, who refused to mend the shoe
of the man that was inimical to his country’s interest. (<i>drinks.</i>)
A glass of as good maximus as e’er tip’t over an exciseman’s
tongue. Here, take hold. (<i>presents it to Dibble.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Dear, Mr. Cobbler, you must pardon me.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> No, no; you, who love me as well as the lord of the manor
himself, must drink with me, or I shall take it unkind, and perhaps
give my vote where I think I am more respected.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Resistance is in vain&mdash;to get his vote I must submit and
take the poison. (<i>aside.</i>) Well, friend Crispin, to show that I
respect you, here’s yours and the King’s good health. (<i>drinks.</i>)
Pshaw, pshaw, it’s a nauseous draught, (<i>aside.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> That’s well (<i>throws his arms round Dibble’s neck.</i>) My dear
friend, that loves me as well as the mayor himself, kiss my cheek,
and then I will believe you are sincere in your friendship.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> There, Crispin. Pshaw, how he stinks of those vile
spirits and tobacco. (<i>aside.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> Give us your fist again (<i>holding him by the hand</i>), my dear
friend, Sir Bilberry, who loves me as well as the mayor himself,
who can descend to drink gin with, and kiss a poor cobbler in his
stall. I heartily thank you, and now I’ll finish my shoe.</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Well, honest Crispin! you promised to vote for me?</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> Who told you so?</p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Oh! my dear, I understand you (<i>taking out his purse</i>)
here are corianders that will purchase hides enough to heel-piece
the whole borough&mdash;here Crispin.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> What! a bribe;&mdash;&mdash;out of my stall, or by Jingo I’ll stick
my awl to the head in your&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><i>Dibble leaves the stall, Crispin follows.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir B.</i> Here’s a transition, Pander.</p>

<p><i>Cris.</i> What! shall Crispin Heel-tap, the cobbler of Steady-town,
give his vote to such a thing as you? A mean-spirited rascal who
can stoop to drink gin in a stall, and to kiss the sweaty cheek of a
poor cobbler? No, no; to serve your purpose you would not mind
stooping to kiss my&mdash;&mdash;, make off while you’re safe. I’ll vote
for none of your Jack-a-Dandy’s, but for my faithful master, Sir
Thomas Trueman&mdash;so away, Sir Fop, you have your answer.</p>

to attack you, the children of the Unions and members of the flock

<p>T. What are you laughing at, you young dog?</p>

<p>P. Why, sir, I really thought you was joking, when you said
ferocious wolf, for I think he is more like a skulking Fox.</p>

<p>T. Aye! you young dog, do you mean to call the big and noble
animal of Winchelsea, a skulking Fox?&mdash;Did he not bravely
challenge the Tiger of Waterloo at Battersea?</p>

<p>P. That he did, sir, and bravely skulked away.</p>

<p>T. What sir! did he not nobly fight, and return the fire?</p>

<p>P. That he did, sir, in the air.</p>

<p>T. But do you mean to say that he flew from the shot?</p>

<p>P. Oh no, sir, for he received a mortal wound in the tail.</p>

<p>T. Well, come come, I find you are a good lad, and learn your
lesson.&mdash;But I was about to say that this big Battersea Hermit said
a short time back that your Unions must be suppressed, for that,
while you are united, the Wolves of St. Stephens cannot easily prey
upon you.&mdash;But, my good children, you that are of the flock of the
Unions, be firm, and Attwood your Shepherd, will defend you from
their avaricious jaws. Now, you sit down, while I hear little
Radical his lesson.&mdash;Now Radical&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>T. There’s a good boy, now get your spelling book, and I will
hear you read the Fable of the Ministers in Danger.</p>

<p>P. (<i>Reading.</i>) There was a Ministry in Danger of a Turn-out,
and many were their opinions concerning the best plan to be adopted
to secure their seats, when a noble Hermit said there was nothing
so good as a Coercion Bill; an Ex-Chancellor (called Bags) said a
Coercion Bill might do very well, but there was nothing so good
nor so essential as the Suppression of the Penny Press; but their
Wise and Grey old Leader being present said, gentlemen, you can
do as you please, but take my word there is nothing like the
Destruction of the Unions.</p>

<p>T. There’s a good child&mdash;now you sit down, and I’ll hear young
Anti his spelling and meanings. Now Anti.</p>

<p>P. Here, sir.</p>

<p>T. Spell me Attwood. (The boy here spells the words, and
gives the meanings as follows.) A tough wood of a good grain,
grows in Birmingham, and is used as the principal material in
building up the Unions.</p>

<p>Brougham. A broom worn to a stump, formerly the Queen’s
own, but now owned by none.</p>

<p>Callthorpe. A word despised by the Whigs, but will ever live in
the hearts of the People.</p>

<p>Dan. A Patriot of the land of Coercion, where St. Patrick
banished the toads, and Stanley the freedom.</p>

<p>Eldon. Old Bags, one that shed an abundance of crocodile tears
without one drop of pity.</p>

<p>Frank. A pretended friend to the people, arrived at his second
childishness, and plays at Shuttlecock with the Electors of Westminster.</p>

<p>Grey. A dealer in humbugs: who behaved as a father to the
people by giving them that which they asked for&mdash;The Bill, the
whole Bill, and <i>Nothing but the Bill</i>!</p>

<p>Hobby. A Westminster Rat, who had so often received the
favours of the people that at last they had nothing to give but
cabbage stumps, which he received in showers at Covent Garden.</p>

<p>Justice. A balance between Might and Right, but always
leaning to power and riches.</p>

<p>King. A title of Monarchy, and Idol of an immense weight.</p>

<p>Loyalty. A word nearly threadbare in some countries.</p>

<p>Mouth. A part of the human body padlocked by law.</p>

<p>Peelers. A body of great Force. Brave and noble conquerors
of an un-armed and peaceable people.</p>

<p>Reform. A word that filled the mouths of thousands, but the
stomachs of few; a thing without benefits.</p>

<p>Truncheon. A knock-down argument of power, an instrument
of the Whigs.</p>

<p>Union. A word despised by all Oppressors.</p>

<p>Verdict. A word lately known as a Terror to the Blues, but the
Glory of others.</p>

<p>T. There’s a good boy, now read me the Fable of the Mountain
and the Mouse.</p>

<p>P. (<i>Reading.</i>) There was a Bill which made a great noise in a
certain country for many years, and they said it was in Labour,
and the People looked with hopes for a Production of great Benefits,
and great was their joy at the thoughts, when after many months
pain and anxiety, it produced a Mouse.</p>

<p>T. I hope my children, this will be a warning to you, never
build your hopes on the promises of those who are reaping the
harvest of your labour, for they will take away your Substance, and
leave you the Shadow to feed upon.</p>

<span class="smaller">AND</span><br />
<span class="largest">SONG ON THE TIMES.</span></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Bill.</i>&mdash;Good morning, Jack, I’m glad to see you. What’s
the meaning of all these Spinners, Piecers, Weavers, Winders,
Grinders, Strippers, Carders, Doffers, Stretchers, Throstle
Spinners, Bobbin Winders, Frame Tenders, and all those folk
that work in these places with big chimneys at top of um’
walking about?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i>&mdash;Why, if thou recollects, a few months back there
wur great talk about the Corn Laws going to come off, and all
these big chaps in the Parliament House, and all these Factory
Lords of Lancashire, said if the Corn Laws wur repealed that
poor people would get plenty of bread for little money, work
would be plentiful, and wages would be a great deal higher;
but instead of that, bread’s dearer, wages is lower, and factories
are on short time.</p>

<p><i>Bill.</i>&mdash;Yes, Jack, I recollect hearing people talk about a lot
of chaps that wur going to bring such times as wur never seen
before, they said that Bobby Peel and Dicky Cobden, and a
great many chaps was going to give us cheap bread, and they
said that we should have plenty of work and get good wages
for it, but I’ve only work’d ten weeks since that corn bill as
they call it past, and I got less wages for it too, Jack.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i>&mdash;These big cotton masters of Lancashire want to drop
poor people’s wages, so to accomplish it they’re only working
four days a week, so that when they start full time again,
they can drop the people’s wages.</p>

<p><i>Bill.</i>&mdash;Well, but Jack, don’t you know when the corn bill
passed, these Masters gave a great sum of money to rejoice and
have grand processions in honour of it passing.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i>&mdash;Don’t you see, Bill, it is poor people that must pay
for it now, for they must work for less wages, or else for short
time.</p>

<p><i>Bill.</i>&mdash;Yes, but Jack, there’s several factories that’s stopping
for a month or two, and some working none at all, and a great
deal breaking down; what’s the reason of that, eh Jack?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i>&mdash;Why the reason of them stopping a month or two is,
they want to get rid of their old hands; so that when they
start again they can have all fresh hands, and reduce their
wages. As for them that are breaking down, it’s a scheme
they’ve got, it’s these chaps that rejoiced so much at the time
the bill passed, and they are ashamed to tell the people that
they’ll have to work for less wages or short time, so they are
breaking down on purpose.</p>

<p><i>Bill.</i>&mdash;Well, I think you’re somewhere about right, Jack,
for there is a deal of factory hands that are walking about and
has nothing to do, so you’ve learnt me something, Jack.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i>&mdash;I bought a new song about these Factory Masters
and their short time system, and if you’ll stop you shall hear
it too.</p>

<i>v.</i><br />
THE POPE’S BULL OF ROME.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“My good Child as it is necessary at this very important
crisis; when, that good pious and very reasonable
old gentleman Pope Pi-ass the nineth has promised
to favour us with his presence, and the pleasures of
Popery&mdash;and trampled on the rights and privilages
which, we, as Englishmen, and Protestants, have engaged
for these last three hundred years&mdash;Since Bluff,
king Hal. began to take a dislike to the broad brimmed
hat of the venerable Cardinal Wolsey, and proclaimed
himself an heretic; It is necessary I say, for you, and
all of you, to be perfect in your Lessons so as you may
be able to verbly chastize this saucy prelate, his newly
made Cardinal Foolishman, and the whole host of
Puseites and protect our beloved Queen, our Church,
and our Constitution.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> Now my boy can you tell me what is your
Name?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> B&mdash;&mdash; Protestant.</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> How came you by that name?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> At the time of Harry the stout, when Popery
was in a galloping consumption the people protested
against the surpremacy and instalence of the Pope; and
his Colleges had struck deep at the hallow tree of superstition
I gained the name of Protestant, and proud am
I, and ever shall be to stick to it till the day of my
death.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Let us say.</i></p>

<p>“From all Cardinals whether wise or foolish. Oh!
Queen Spare us.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Spare us, Oh Queen.</i></p>

<p>“From the pleasure of the Rack, and the friendship
of the kind hearted officers of the Inquisition. Oh!
Johnny hear us.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Oh! Russell hear us.</i></p>

<p>“From the comforts of being frisled like a devil’d
kidney. Oh! Nosey save us.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Hear us, Oh Arthur.</i></p>

<p>“From such saucy Prelates, as Pope Pi-ass. Oh!
Cumming save us.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Save us good Cumming.</i>”</p>

<p>“And let us have no more Burnings in smithfield,
no more warm drinks in the shape of boiled oil, or,
molten lead, and send the whole host of Pusyites
along with the Pope, Cardinals to the top of mount
Vesuvius, there to dine off of hot lava, so that we
may live in peace &amp; shout long live our Queen,
and No Popery!”</p>

<p class="center">“<i>The Lesson of the Day.</i>”</p>

<p>“You seem an intelligent lad, so I think you are
quite capable of Reading with me the Lessons for this
day’s service.</p>

<p>“Now the Lesson for the day is taken from all parts
of the Book of Martyr’s, beginning at just where you
like.</p>

<p>“It was about the year 1835, that a certain renagade
of the name of Pussy&mdash;I beg his pardon, I mean Pusey,
like a snake who stung his master commenced crawling
step by step, from the master; he was bound to serve
to worship a puppet, arrayed in a spangle and tinsel of
a romish showman.</p>

<p>“And the pestilance that he shed around spread
rapidly through the minds of many unworthy members
of our established Church; even up to the present year,
1850, inasmuch that St. Barnabus, of Pimlico, unable
to see the truth by the aid of his occulars, mounted four
pounds of long sixes in the mid-day, that he might see
through the fog of his own folly, by which he was surrounded.</p>

<p>“And Pope Pi-ass the nineth taking advantage of
the hubub, did create unto himself a Cardinal in the
person of one Wiseman of Westminster.</p>

<p>“And Cardinal broadbrim claimed four counties in
England as his dioces, and his master the Pope claimed
as many more as his sees, but the people of England
could not see that, so they declared aloud they would
see them blowed first.</p>

<p>“So when Jack Russell heard of his most impudent
intentions, he sent him a Letter saying it was the
intention of the people of England never again to submit
to their infamous mumerys for the burnings in
Smithfield was still fresh in their memory.</p>

<p>“And behold great meetings were held in different
parts of England where the Pope was burnt in effigy,
like unto a Yarmouth Bloater, as a token of respect for
him and his followers.</p>

<p>“And the citizens of London were stanch to a man,
and assembled together in the Guildhall of our mighty
City and shouted with stentarian lungs, long live the
Queen and down with the Pope, the sound of which
might have been heard even unto the vatican of Rome.</p>

<p>“And when his holyness the Pope heard that his
power was set at naught, his nose became blue even as a
bilberry with rage and declared Russell and Cummings
or any who joined in the No Popery cry, should ever
name the felisity of kissing his pious great toe.</p>

<p>Question.&mdash;Now my child, what is your Name?</p>

<p>Answer.&mdash;Weathercock Johnny, alias Jack the
Reformer, of the tribe of Russellites.</p>

<p>Q.&mdash;Who gave you that Name?</p>

<p>A.&mdash;My Godfathers and Godmothers, the People of
England, who are called the great unwashed.</p>

<p>Q.&mdash;And what do the People of England want you
to do?</p>

<p>A.&mdash;First, they want to amend my ways, which they
say are in a most shaky condition. Secondly, to take a
few of Palmerston’s pills, which they say will invigorate
my Political system. And, Thirdly, to stick up for
the Rights of the People, and speak up according to
my size, as long as I remain in office.</p>

<p>Q.&mdash;And do you think that you are capable of holding
firm by the reins, and steer the good coach Constitution,
in safety through the mud and mire of these
macadamized times, and not as you have done before,
getting your unlucky feet in a plug-hole.</p>

AND BELIEF.</h3>

<p>To be said by all true Liberals, at all outdoor or indoor Meetings, at all Committee Rooms,
and in front of all Hustings on which the Gladstonites and the Dizzeyites are to contend for
the Managership at the forthcoming Elections, and to see who is to gain the belt, and rule the
roast at St. Stephen’s. To be said without Barrel Organ or Grindstone accompaniment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, my boy, as the Great Election is about to take
place, and it becomes us all to sail under true colours,
be so good as to tell me what you are, a Gladstonite, or
a Dizzyite?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i>&mdash;Why a Gladstonite to the backbone, and no
mistake.</p>

<p>There is a good lad; now let me hear you rehearse
the Gladstone or Liberal Belief.</p>

<p>I believe in Bill Gladstone to be the true Champion
of Reform, and that he is a perfect game cock, and that
he will stick his spurs into the comb of any tory mountebank
who shall attempt to set the working-man’s rights
and privileges at naught; and I believe at the coming
election that all true liberals will put their shoulders to
the wheel and obtain a first-rate majority, not only in
Church Reform, but in all things where reformation is
wanted; and that Gladstone and his friends will reach
the tip top of the poll, and start the tories off like
scalded cocks, and this I firmly believe. So help me
John Brown.</p>

<p>There is a good boy, now let us enlighten our friends
on events, past, present, and future.</p>

<p>Now in the first place, there is Gladstone’s Irish
Church Question! it is a stickler to many, more
especially to Dizzey, the Isrælite, for it is to him like
the carpenter’s saw, which the black cook said stuck in
his gizzard.</p>

<p>For the Dizzeyites were sorely vexed by a political
squib, which was recited by some of the unwashed in
Hyde Park, who made a goodly collection, which went
into the pockets of the Collectors in the usual manner.</p>

<p>And behold the Dizzeyites and Adullamites were
alarmed, and they said who hath done this evil which is
so likely to rob our fat shepherds of the golden wash
they have so long fed upon.</p>

<p>And Sarah Gamp of the Standard did cause large
bills to be posted in every corner, equal in size to the
top of a large dining table, headed with these words,
“Gladstone and his Friends,” showing how the needle
had pricked their tender feelings.</p>

<p>And Dizzey was down on his luck, when he found
that his nose was compared to double size, and he hid
himself in a corner and wept.</p>

<p>And behold there arose a loud cry from the ladies of
England, saying, we are man’s better half, why not let
us have a voice in the affairs of our country, and not
have our tongues muzzled like D&mdash; M&mdash; as served our
dogs.</p>

<p>And moreover it is expected that when the Election
takes place that the vendors of dog’s meat, headed by
Jack Atchley and some of the nobs from Sharp’s alley will
proceed to Scotland yard to petition D&mdash; M&mdash; to revoke
the sentence on our blessed tykes; for they say if it goes
on much longer, instead of skewing up meat for the dogs
they will be skewered up themselves&mdash;in some union
house washing their blessed inside with water-gruel.</p>

<p>Now behold B&mdash; S&mdash; of penny newspaper notoriety
is again attempting to poke his nose in for Westminster,
but he will find it is no go, for with Mill and Grosvenor
before him, he will have no chance to walk in for our
ancient and much respected borough.</p>

<p>And all tories and adullamites are hereby cautioned
not to have any dirty tricks, at the coming Election, as
they had at the Guildhall Meeting, when they hired
land rats and water rats at two bob a nob to disturb the
peace, or they may find something in the seat of their
small clothes more than their shirt tails.</p>

<p>Thus endeth the morning’s address.</p>

<p class="center larger">LET US SAY.</p>

<p>From all back-sliding liberals, or slop made adullamites,
Friends of Reform spare us.</p>

<p class="right">Spare us we implore thee.</p>

<p>From all tories who would give us such quarters as
the wolf gives the lamb. Gladstone, the father of the
people, save us!</p>

<p class="right">Gladstone, look down upon us.</p>

<p>From being gobbled up by Dizzey’s “No Popery”
bogey, noble army of liberals defend us.</p>

<p class="right">From Dizzey’s Guy Faux keep us we beseech thee.</p>

<p>And oh, Lawrence, when you are made king of the
city, let us have no more unseemly brawls in Guildhall.</p>

<p class="right">From all paid ruffians, save us good Lawrence.</p>

<p>And may it please you, good Richard, to look down
with an eye of pity on all distressed dog’s meat sellers,
and take the harness from off the dogs, so that we may
obtain food to supply the worms that now gnaw our
hungry bowels.</p>

<p class="right">Grant this, there’s a dear Dickey.</p>

<p>And oh, Dizzey, make your will, there’s a good boy,
for at the forthcoming election, Gladstone and the whole
host of Liberals will be at the top of the poll, and then
farewell to all your greatness.</p>

<p class="right">And I say so be it.</p>

ON THE<br />
<span class="larger">TIMES.</span></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the present ministry shall cease their humbuging
tricks, and do that which is lawful and right for
the benefit of the working classes, then, and not till
then, shall they receive our praise.</p>

<p>Dearly Beloved Brethren&mdash;Hunger moveth us at
various times and in sundry places, to make known
unto our Most Gracious Majesty, the Queen Victoria,
our dreadful wants and sufferings, and although we
ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our Most
Gracious Majesty the Queen, yet the cry of our starving
children prevent us from so doing.</p>

<p class="center">The Lesson for the Day is taken from the present
hard times.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in the year ’65, that there was a
great stoppage in the tide of politics, and the steersman,
Pam, gave up the helm; and the Queen sent unto the
Land o’ Cakes for a certain little man of the tribe of
Russellites, well known by the name of Financial Jack,
by some called Little John, who being fond of lollipops,
and having a sweet tooth, it will be remembered he
called out lustily for cheap sugar.</p>

<p>And when he arrived at the Castle, which is situated
near unto the great park at Windsor, the Queen said
unto him, Johnny, Johnny, thy friend Pam has cut his
stick, and if thou thinkest thyself strong enough, the
place is thine.</p>

<p>Whereupon the little man bowed and bowed till the
rim fell off his hat; but when he tried on the garments
of Pam, the coat fitted him like unto a purser’s coat on
a marlin-spike.</p>

<p>And the people murmured, saying, this man is totally
unfit for the berth, but for the want of a better he was
accepted.</p>

<p class="right">Amen.</p>

<p>And about this time there arose in the Land of Spuds
tribes of men who call themselves Feenanites, who
promised to march unto the house of St. Stephen’s
straightway, to get something taken from them by
honest John Bull.</p>

<p>But a messenger came from that land to the house
of St. Stephen’s straightway, to inform the inmates
thereof they were in danger.</p>

<p>And there was great trouble in the House, and the
servants arose and went out to meet them.</p>

<p>But when they arrived near unto that part of the
land, behold, they had flew, leaving nought behind
them to take back but a few sticks, like unto popguns,
with which they had been learning to play at soldiers,
so they returned home.</p>

<p class="right">Amen.</p>

<p>And O, Gladstone, thou good and faithful servant of
the late Steersman Pam, take unto thyself the helm of
the good ship Great Britain, and steer it safely through
the troubled waters that now surround it.</p>

<p class="right">Amen.</p>

<p>Let us say,</p>

<p>From all impositions of unjust stewards,</p>

<p>O Queen deliver us,</p>

<p>We beseech thee to hear us, O Queen.</p>

<p>And O Johnny, if thou take unto thyself the helm
of the good ship Great Britain, steer her safely through
the troubled waters of poverty that now surround her.</p>

<p>Hear us, O Russell.</p>

<p>We beseech thee to hear us, O Jack.</p>

<p>And from being slaughtered by the Fenians,</p>

<p>O Queen deliver us.</p>

<p>We beseech thee to hear us, O Vick.</p>

<p>And from all heavy taxation,</p>

<p>O Johnny, save us.</p>

<p>We beseech thee to hear us, O Russell.</p>

<p>And from all bad meat, O Queen deliver us.</p>

<p>We beseech thee to hear us, O Queen.</p>

<p>And O thou mighty Queen, grant that we may have
a cheap loaf, and each man paid justly for his daily
labour, that we may live in peace and happiness both
now and for evermore.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

On the Present Session of Parliament.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Whigs shall cease to be a milk and water
set, and prove to the people of England, that like good
and trusty servants they will stick up for their rights,
and pass such measures as will be for the benefit of the
nation at large: then, and not till then, shall we consider
them as trumps, and look upon them with confidence.</p>

<p>Dearly bought and never-to-be-forgotten Johnny.&mdash;To
your noble and all-powerful self, do we, an over-taxed,
poorly-fed people appeal, trusting that, O most
merciful Johnny, that by the virtue of thy most exalted
position, that you will be pleased to intercede with our
Most Gracious Majesty, that she will reside amongst us,
and so improve the condition of the tradesmen and
mechanics of this mighty metropolis, whose affairs now
are in a most shaky condition. Grant this, O most
mighty John, and we will pray for the well-being of
thy favourite bantling, Reform, that you have nursed
with such care for so many years, and will sing praises
unto thee, now and evermore. Amen.</p>

<p>Now the Services for the Day is taken from unprinted
Bills that lay on or under the tables of the House of
Incurables, better known by the name of St. Stephen’s.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass in the second month of the year
’66, and on the first day of the month, that the Dictators
who formed the seventh Parliament in the reign of
Good Queen Vic, assembled together to consider the
weighty affairs of the nation, and after relating their
rigs and sprees during the holidays, adjourned to crack
a bottle and a joke at the expense of patient John Bull.</p>

<p>And again on the 6th they met in the presence of our
Good Queen, and after bestowing six thousand a-year
out of the pockets of the people as a trifle for pin money
for a certain little lady, they wished the Queen good
day, shook their heads, and went to lunch, entirely worn
out with their morning’s labour.</p>

<p>And they held long discussions on the plague among
the cattle, and soon came to the sage conclusion, that
beasts that were ill could not be in good health; but
whether it was the cow or chicken pock they were not
prepared to say.</p>

<p>But the people cried aloud that it was done to raise
the price of meat, and those who used to treat themselves
to a joint on a Sunday were compelled to put up
with a few ornaments from off the block.</p>

<p>Now near unto the commencement of the year, great
excitement was caused through the land, of strange
revelations concerning a certain tribe of persons called
paupers, whose treatment in the Whig Bastiles, or
Union-houses, were likened unto swine; and the rate-payers
of Lambeth, and people in general, cried out
sorely against the Poor Law nabobs, and the ratepayers
cried, Turn off the unworthy servants of the poor and
give the inheritance to others.</p>

<p>And behold, great alarm is being caused in different
parts of this mighty city, on account of the many rail-roads
in course of construction; and numbers of Her
Majesty’s most loyal subjects, such as the small shopkeeper
and poorer classes, are being driven from their
homes, and by being deprived of the means of obtaining
their living, will be compelled to find shelter in the
workhouse, and so swell the rates imposed upon the
hard-working tradesman.</p>

<p>And they pray the present ministry now assembled,
to stay the progress of this destructive juggernaut; and
as there has been day by day great outcry about the
many accidents caused by them, they beg of them to
pass a clause in the acts for the regulation of railways,
that they shall supply a sufficient number of surgeons
with splints and bandages to each train, and a goodly
supply of coffins at each station for the use of those who
are headstrong enough to travel by them.</p>

<p>Thus endeth the morning lesson.</p>

<p class="center larger">LET US SAY.</p>

<p>O most noble Johnny, pull yourself together, and
spare us the necessity of selecting another steward.</p>

<p>Hear us, O Russell.</p>

<p>And O, most Gracious Queen, gladden the hearts of
thy people by dwelling amongst them, and so improve
the trade of thy most loyal subjects in this mighty city.</p>

<p>We beseech thee to hear us, O Queen.</p>

<p>From having our roads turned into honeycombs, and
endangering our lives by being swallowed up by the
underground railways, spare us we implore thee.</p>

<p>Railway Committees, spare us.</p>

<p>And O, much respected Chancellor of the Exchequer,
repeal the duty upon malt, as thou hast done upon tea,
so that we may refresh ourselves with a good and
wholesome pot of beer, to the glory of thy good name.</p>

<p>O Gladstone, hear us.</p>

<p>And we implore thee to spare our poorer brethren
from being compelled to pig upon dirty floors in Union
Bastiles, or by being poisoned by bathing in a dirty soup
kettle.</p>

<p>Good Farnell, and the whole host of parish nabobs,
spare us.</p>

<p>Be just before you are liberal, and waste not the
public money in useless expenditure.</p>

<p>Minister of Finance, we beseech thee to hear us.</p>

<p>Spare us from being starved in the land of plenty,
Good Bright.</p>

<p>O Bright, have mercy upon us.</p>

<p>And O Gladstone, thou brightest star in the political
hemisphere; keep thy weather-eye open, and jog the
memory of thy fellow-servant John, and guide his little
feet if he should by chance to stray from the right path.</p>

<p>O Gladstone watch over the welfare of the people.</p>

<p>And now, Johnny, we implore thee to act with justice
to the country, and give us the benefit of Reform
which is so much needed, and grant in all thy works,
that you study the interests of the most patient and industrious
people in the world, so that they may be
blessed with peace and plenty, then will they sing, Long
live the Queen, and good luck to her ministers. Amen.</p>

<span class="larger">DERBYITES, DIZZYITES,</span><br />

<span class="larger">ADULLAMITES,</span><br />
<span class="smaller">AND THE</span><br />
<span class="larger">WHOLE HOST OF TORY CABINET MAKERS,</span></h3>

<p class="center">Who were tried at St. Stephen’s, for conspiring to burke the People’s Reform, and attempting to pass a Counterfeit
Bill instead of a Genuine Article; thereby imposing upon a certain respectable firm, well-known as Messrs John
Bull and Company. The prosecution was conducted by those able Advocates for Reform, Bright and Gladstone.
The offenders were undefended, as no one could be found willing to take their cause in hand on account of their
previous bad character.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now the trial of these Anti-Reformers was highly
amusing, owing to the singular conduct of some of the
offenders.</p>

<p>And the proceedings was prefaced by that old-stock
farce called the Struggle for Reform, or John Bull mesmerised.</p>

<p>And the advocates for the people said unto the
Derbyites and their companions, what have you to say
in your behalf concerning this fraud on the working
classes of England?</p>

<p>Now behold one of them was a clever mountebank of
the tribe of Dizzyites, and like many of his kind he had
a happy knack of saying a great deal which amounted
to nothing; and he commenced his defence with a mock
speech on Reform, which seemed to say: If you Reformers
do not unbutton your eyelids, and expand your
understandings, I shall most certainly mystify you with
my high presto, cockalorum jig!</p>

<p>And he had as many tricks as those amusing little
marmozettes that are to be seen in the gardens of the
Regent’s Park.</p>

<p>And when he had concluded he turned to the people
and said, how do you like me now?</p>

<p>And there arose a murmur through St. Stephen’s,
saying, Not at all, you are not in our style.</p>

<p>And Dizzy the mountebank was much grieved for he
thought he had caused a great sensation, and he exclaimed,
Dizzy, Dizzy, thy occupation’s gone.</p>

<p>And Lowe the Adullamite, surnamed the moonraker,
pleaded guilty to his offences against the people, and
prayed for a mitigation of his sentence, on the plea that
he could not have been in his right mind.</p>

<p>And the poor gentleman could not have been sane for
he rambled on with some nonsense about the mark of
Cain being set upon some people’s brows; and asked
the good citizens of London to order mass to be said for
his own sins, or the success of the Bill; his strange
manner left us in a fog to understand which.</p>

<p>Now the chief of the Derbyites being alarmed at the
meetings in Trafalgar Square and throughout England,
did call a council in the privy which layeth in the
neighbourhood of Downing Street, to form plans by
which they might overthrow the honest Bright, and all
those who were on the side of the people.</p>

<p>For the Tories, finding that their seats were in a
shaky condition, and being fond of place and pensions,
were determined to stick at nothing rather than give up
their golden kitchen stuff of office.</p>

<p>And behold their work must have been exceedingly
bad, inasmuch as some of their pals said no: we will
leave your company, for we will not join with you in
this plot against the working classes of England.</p>

<p>And it was strongly suspected that Dizzy the Mountebank,
eager for a goodly share of the loaves and fishes,
communed with himself, saying, I will write up no
connection with the head Cabinet Maker of the Upper
House, and then the whole business will be mine.</p>

<p>And the Reformers were well pleased, for they said
the old adage will then be verified that when rogues
fall out honest men will get their rights.</p>

<p>Now it was thought that they would have called
upon D&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;, the head of the Poleaxes, to speak
in their behalf; but that hero having the remembrance
of the Hyde Park battle before his eyes, declined to
appear, saying, He had received striking proof of the
justice of the cause.</p>

<p>Now it was in the 3rd month of the year, and on the
18th day of the month, being the day after St. Patrick
that the Tory Cabinet Makers appeared to receive
judgement; and the Council for the People said unto
them, If you do not give us the bill, the whole bill, and
nothing but a satisfactory bill, giving to the people
what is justly their rights, the sentence of this court
will be that you will get the infernal sack now and for
evermore.</p>

<span class="largest">NEW LITANY ON REFORM.</span></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Tories shall grant to the people a share of
what is justly their own, and not take all the loaves and
fishes themselves, as they always have done; like the
lawyer who swallowed the oyster and gave his client
the shells; then, and not till then, shall they gain our
thanks.</p>

<p>Sorely oppressed and heavily taxed brethren, duty
calls us, as the bone and sinew of this mighty nation to
assert our rights and privileges, and although we at all
times ought to do so, yet ought we more strongly when
we assemble and meet together to take such steps as are
necessary to obtain manhood suffrage, and all things
likely to elevate our condition as freeborn Englishmen,
and not slaves to any intolerant faction, such as now
assert their despotic power in St. Stephens’ Infirmary.
So I charge as many of you as here present, who are
friends to Reform, to act firmly in the cause, and never
rest till it is gained.</p>

<p>Now, it was shortly after the premature death of the
Russell administration, that the Tories took office, and
a couple of chiefs of the tribes of the Derbyites and
D’Israelites laid their heads together, to consider in
what way they might destroy the substance, and bamboozle
the working man.</p>

<p>And the D’Israelite said to the Derbyite keep your
whip still, and I will pull the string, and the day will
be our own. So the Derbyite was like unto the dolls
in the toy shops, that say, we will cry for sixpence.</p>

<p>And about this time, loud shouts was heard for
Reform, and the echo was carried throughout the length
and breadth of the land.</p>

<p>And the whole host of Derbyites shook, as if struck
with the palsy, and their chief was sorely alarmed, so
that his hair stood out from his head like unto the quills
of the porcupine, and he cried, Oh, Dizzy, save us!</p>

<p>And behold there sprung up on the face of the earth
a new race of people called Adullamites, who were like
unto their namesakes of old, a dissatisfied and two-faced
people, and like the camelon could change their colour
at will.</p>

<p>And their chief was a <i>Low</i>(e) man from the land of
moonrakers; and him and his colleagues were the
Reformers of to-day and the Tories of to-morrow.</p>

<p>And they said to the people, behold we are on thy
side, at the same time they were seeking how they
might destroy their cause.</p>

<p>And they combined with certain unprincipled electors,
and by bribery and corruption made their way into the
house of St. Stephen’s.</p>

<p>But when they got into the house, the mask fell from
off their unworthy faces, and instead of Reformers, they
appeared as labour-grinding Tories.</p>

<p>And the people murmured, saying, they are like unto
Esau of old, who sold his birthright for a mess of potage,
and there is no trust in them.</p>

<p>And it was in the 7th month of the year, when the
gnats bite the hardest, that the Reformers declared their
intention of assembling in Hyde Park to set forth their
honest claims, and hear the most truthful voices of the
worthy Beale and the Delegates.</p>

<p>And the Tories became alarmed, and W&mdash;&mdash; sent in
haste to Dicky M&mdash;&mdash;, the renowned head of all the
poleaxes, to march with his army, and stop the much
dreaded invasion.</p>

<p>But the people said, who is he who stays us from
meeting in a place that is justly our own? And they
laid on for Reform, and lo! the rails quickly passed
away, and not a vestige was to be seen.</p>

<p>And when the Chief of the Poleaxes saw what was
done, his nose turned as blue as his coat, and he cried,
On to the charge!</p>

<p>But behold, while he was whistling, see the conquering
hero comes, a brick, hurled by no friendly hand,
caught his head unexpectedly, and his charger turned
and whispered, Dicky, how is your poor nob?</p>

<p>Thus endeth the Lesson.</p>

<p class="center larger">LET US SAY,</p>

<p>From all Tory intolerance save us, Reformers.</p>

<p>Friends of Reform, hear us.</p>

<p>From bribery and corruption, and the whole host of
Adullamites, and all that have not clean hands, Election
Commissioners, spare us.</p>

<p>Your attention I claim, Captain Jinks is my name,
and with your permission, I hold a commission, in Her
Majesty’s famed horse marines.</p>

<p>I have lines here for your inspection, on the coming
election, and I’ll try to amuse, that is if you choose, by
relating a wonderful dream.</p>

<p>It was t’other night, I got rather tight, I had been
to the Alhambra, to see the grand things there, and
roll’d home at two in my glory.</p>

<p>And I dreamt a queer dream, though strange it may
seem, that I heard a conversation, or a confabulation,
between Gladstone and Dizzy, the Tory.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I had a dream the other night; and the same I’ll lay before ye,</div>
<div class="verse">A conversation on the coming election, between Gladstone and Dizzy, the Tory.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Said Gladstone, Dizzy my rum ’un, the time is a
coming, though you think yourself clever, you will find
so help my never, at the forthcoming general election,</p>

<p>That your goose will be cooked, and you must take
your hook, for like a cow’s tail you will find, you will
be all behind, when the people they make their selection.</p>

<p>Then said Dizzy it is plain, Gladstone, you want the
reins, and between you and me, your Reform and cheap
tea, you fancy will carry you straight, sir.</p>

<p>But I know what your wish is, to prig my loaves and
fishes, but Gladstone my hearty, I’ll lick you and your
party, and stick to my stall, so help me tater.</p>

<p>Ben, your No Popery cry, it is all my eye, and your
cant and your crawling, shews you are afraid of falling,
for of honesty you have not a spark, Ben.</p>

<p>For you and your chums dirty, got dreadful shirty,
but that is not worst, sir, said I fell to the gutter, when
my friends met like bricks in Hyde Park, Ben.</p>

<p>Says Dizzy, I know Bill, you think your Irish Church
Bill, with the aid of the donovans, will make you A
No. 1, but you will find in the end it’s no use man.</p>

<p>For it is a great shame man, that with Bradlaugh
and Finlen, and the rest of your Pets, should make this
cabal, to capsize church and constitution.</p>

<p>Said Gladstone, that is it, if the cap did not fit, Sally
Gamp of the Standard, would not have stuck up her
placards, unless you Tories had got some queer twitches,</p>

<p>But they have made a mistake, sir, it’s a mere waste
of paper, and if they come up to the scratch, they will
find the Liberals their match, and they may chance to
have an earthquake in their breeches.</p>

<p>Says Dizzy, I know, that old Jemmy Squaretoe, to
himself will you take man, for running down shovel
hats and silk aprons, and I wonder you can sleep in
your bed, Bill,</p>

<p>For in Hyde Park it was said, that a litany was read,
and it said, and no flies, my nose was like double size,
and my curly hair shook on my head, Bill.</p>

<p>Gladstone said by-the-bye, there has been a loud cry,
which is nothing unkimmon, for it comes from the
women, they declare they will rule if they like, Ben.</p>

<p>They say, at home in their houses, they can rule their
spouses, and they seem rather puzzled, that their tongues
should be muzzled, like D&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; muzzled our
tykes, Ben.</p>

<p>Dizzy said, bless the ladies, they are well in their
places, to wash and dress babbies, and lecture the
daddies; and some in homes they are graceful.</p>

<p>They can rule in the kitchen, and cook puddings&mdash;if
they can get them,&mdash;and to say they’re not clever, I’d
not venture, no, never! when I think upon old Madam
Rachel.</p>

<p>Gladstone said, my Cockawax, there is that cursed
income tax upon trades and professions, I’d like to sing
its dying speech and confession, for it robs the poor man

<h3><a name="A_POLITICAL_THANKSGIVING" id="A_POLITICAL_THANKSGIVING"></a><span class="larger">A POLITICAL THANKSGIVING</span><br />
<span class="smaller">FOR THE</span><br />
Great and Glorious Victory Gained by the Liberals, and the Complete Defeat
of the Tories!!!</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much respected and truly victorious brethren, and all
who have lent a liberal hand in sticking the axe of Reform
so deeply into the root of that old contemptible
tree called Toryism. I have this day come amongst
you to offer up a thanksgiving for the great victory
gained by Gladstone and his brave army at the Great
Election, and also to offer my sympathy for the alarming
illness of the Tories, who are suffering from an attack
of the <i>place fever</i>; and all true Liberals are invited to
be present and take the front places, as Gladstone and
his comrades will in the House of St. Stephen’s. And
all Tories and Adullamites are requested to keep in the
background, where they will remain now and for evermore,
and not disturb the present congregation, or they
will be given into the custody of the beadle.</p>

<p>Now the Lesson for the Day is taken from the battle
with the Gladstonites and the Dizzyites at the late
Elections.</p>

<p>Now for many years past the Tories have been a
place seeking and ease loving people, greasing their
chins with the lion’s share of what justly is the rights
of the working classes of this mighty land.</p>

<p>And the people communed together, saying, who are
those who toil not nor yet spin, and yet they swallow
up all the grain, and leave us nought but the husks to
eat.</p>

<p>And lo there arose a mighty host called the Liberals,
whose chieftain was named Gladstone, who was in himself
a tower of strength, who with the Spear of Liberty
sorely wounded the Tory chief, who was surnamed
Dizzy the Isrælite.</p>

<p>And, behold, it was in the dismal month of November,&mdash;the
season so fatal to all shakey constitutions&mdash;that
the Tories became alarmingly ill, and at the Great
Election Battles found that their power was passing
away, and that they were dead licked.</p>

<p>And the victory that was gained by the Liberals was
sorely painful to Dizzy the Tory Chief, for he had said
in the fulness of his political health, “Show me the
man who will tread on the skirts of my coat.” But his
boasting was like unto the mountain that became pregnant,
and brought forth a mouse.</p>

<p>For Gladstone the Liberal put forth his foot, and lo,
Dizzy’s Government was rent in twain.</p>

<p>Then went the Chief of the Tories unto the Castle
which lieth near unto the Great Park of Windsor, and
threw himself at the feet of our good Queen Victoria,
saying, Bill Gladstone, the head boy in our school at
Westminster, has given me such a fright, that I feel
quite white, and I am afraid if I stay any longer, the
other boys will chaff me, and say, “Dizzy, Dizzy, I’ll
have your curls!”</p>

<p>Then did the Queen send for Bill Gladstone, and said
unto him, Are you afraid, too? But Gladstone spoke
up boldly, saying, Not I. Then said the Lady of the
Castle, Get you back to St. Stephen’s, and be head
teacher in the room of the boy Dizzy.</p>

<p>And Sarah Gamp, of the Tory cess-pool, sung quite
small when she heard of the disgrace her favourite boy
had got into.</p>

<p>And since the Great Election has taken place, it has
been rumoured that certain Tories has been coming the
Rachel dodge, and has been trying to make themselves
beautiful for ever, by rubbing themselves with golden
ointment, which has so dazzled the eyes of some of the
free and independent electors, that they will not be able
to see clearly until Gladstone and his friends settle the
hash by giving us the ballot.</p>

<p class="center">Thus endeth the Lesson for the Day.</p>

<p class="center larger">Let us all say,</p>

<p>For giving the command into the safe keeping of
General Gladstone, oh, Queen, we give unto thee our
thanks.</p>

<p class="right">We thank thee, oh, Queen.</p>

<p>From being left to the tender mercies of the Tories.
Friends of Freedom save us.</p>

<p class="right">Spare us, we beseech thee.</p>

<p>And oh, Lowe, since Gladstone has duly installed you
as Keeper of the National Cash-box, let us have none
of your hanky-panky or Adullamite tricks, as you had
at the time of the great Reform Meeting, when you
charged the working-men with being a vile, degenerate,
and beer-swilling crew.</p>

<p>Now, Lowe, none of your moon-raking capers, or I
shall give you another taste of my rod of correction.</p>

<p>And, oh, Gladstone, give them a plentiful supply of
Liberal pills, to purge them of impurity.</p>

<p class="right">Warm them, good Gladstone.</p>

<p>And, oh, Dizzy, my lad, keep up your pecker, and
don’t be cast down, for Gladstone is a good sort of a
chap, and if you behave yourself, I dare say he will
give you a job.</p>

<p class="right">Do not fret, Dizzy, there’s a good boy.</p>

<p>And, oh, D&mdash;&mdash;, we thank you for paying attention
to our last prayer, by kindly removing the spectacles
from off the dog’s noses, and when the roasted chesnuts
and boys hoop question is settled, turn your great mind
into another channel, and devise some means of ridding
us of the garrotting ruffians that now infest our streets
and highways in the open daylight.</p>

<p class="right">Do D&mdash;&mdash;, and we shall bless thee.</p>

<p>And now to Gladstone and all who have fought so
nobly to gain this great victory, be all thanks due, and
may they stick like bricks to the cause, and do their
duty at the forthcoming Sessions of Parliament, and
they shall receive our praises now and for evermore.</p>

<p class="right">Amen.</p>

<span class="wordpicture">ON THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN.</span>
<img class="wordpicture" src="images/on-the-rights-of-women.jpg" width="542" height="40" alt="ON THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN." /></h3>

<p class="center larger">To be read by all married women to their husbands, and by all single
ones to their sweethearts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/divider-horizontal-1.jpg" width="250" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="center">At a meeting of women the other day, that dear old lady, Mrs. Caudle, amused the ladies present, by reading
her Belief and Commandments on the rights and privileges of married women; so after taking half-a-dozen pinches
of snuff and a couple of glasses of eye-water, and coughing three times, she commenced as follows:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I believe, that has some one has said, that woman is
man’s better, and sometimes his bigger half, and the
best friend he has got to his back; she should not only
rule the roast at home, but have a voice in the affairs of
the country to which she belongs! and I not only
believe, but I am quite sure, that it is her husband’s
place to obey her in everything, and patiently attend to
her commandments, and then, and not till then, will
curtain lectures cease.</p>

<p>Now my first commandment, if I was married, would
be this, I would say to my husband.</p>

<p>1st. You must never think of, or even look at any
other woman but me, for am sure the parson must have
made a mistake when he said, woman, obey your
husbands.</p>

<p>2nd. You must never make me jealous by praising
those forward jades that wear those ugly things on their
heads called chignons, but keep your eye wholly on me,
and study my wants both day and night, or I will
comb your head with a small tooth bellows, that’s what
I will, and no mistake.</p>

<p>3rd. Before going to work in the morning, you must
light the fire and make me a strong cup of tea, with
something nice in it in case I should have the wind,
and you must not grumble if the kettle does not boil
when you come home to breakfast.</p>

<p>4th. Six days must work from six to six, that you
may provide me with the comforts of life, and on the
seventh, you may scrub the floor, peel the potatoes,
make the dumplings, and cook the dinner. In the
afternoon, by way of amusement, you must take the
children to the park and show the little darlings the
ducks.</p>

<p>5th. If any of the children should have the measles,
or the blessed baby should require weaning, you must
get up without a murmer and give it the bottle, lest I
might be disturbed by its crying.</p>

<p>6th. You must not crib a shilling from your wages
on Saturday night, but fork it all out and be contented
with the pocket money I shall think fit to give you.</p>

<p>7th. You must not get in a state of beer on any
pretence whatever, or I shall compel you to sleep at the
foot of the bed for six weeks.</p>

<p>8th. You must not take my name in vain by calling
me other than my dear, or my duck, nor lay finger on
me, lest I should give you six months to learn you
better manners.</p>

<p>9th. You must not dare to grumble if your shirt
should be minus of buttons, or you should be compelled
to eat a cold dinner at least three days during the week,
if it should be my pleasure to go out for amusement.</p>

<p>10th. You must not covet to be trusted with the
latch key in the evening, you must not covet to visit
the Alhambra or the Oxford, nor any other such like
place; you must not look at the girls’ legs on a windy
day, nor rule your house or your spouse, or anything
this is within, but be a good boy and keep my
commandments.</p>

<h3><a name="A_NEW_EDITION_OF_THE_LITANY" id="A_NEW_EDITION_OF_THE_LITANY"></a>A NEW EDITION OF THE LITANY<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE</span><br />
IRISH CHURCH QUESTION</h3>

<p class="center">Not exactly sanctioned by either Bishop, Parson, Curate, or any other Prelate. It is not to
be said or sung in either Church or Chapel, but to be learnt by all persons without distinction
to creed, country, or colour. Composed on the Great Battle which lately took place in
St. Stephen’s House of Incurables.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the rulers of this mighty Babylon shall be like
unto good stewards, and render unto the people, things
that are the people’s, and purge the Established Church
of its many impurities, not only in Ireland and Scotland,
but in this mighty and loyal city, and allow every
tub to stand on its own bottom, then, and not till then
will this war cease, which has so long been an abomination
in the land.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sorely oppressed and heavily taxed Brethren:&mdash;</p>

<p>It becomes us all to be up and doing, and assist this
monster question of the day&mdash;the Irish Church Bill&mdash;no
matter what your creed may be, whether it be
Catholic, Protestant, Quakers, Shakers, Spirit Rappers,
or Tub Thumpers, who have so long forked out the
golden grain which has so greedily been swallowed by
Mother Church and her hungry chickens.</p>

<p class="center">The lesson for the Day is taken from the late debate on
on the Church Question.</p>

<p>Now in the days of darkness, when Fat Harry, the
Bluebeard King of England, joined in unholy wedlock
the Lion of State to Lady Lawn Sleeves, the people
were troubled with a blindness, which has continued
for upwards of three hundred years.</p>

<p>But of late, the film has fell from off their eyes, and
they murmured saying, why pay we tribute to those
from whom we receive nothing, and for buildings we
do not enter?</p>

<p>But the masters in lawn, replied, we say unto you,
pay you must, for such is the law of the land.</p>

<p>But lo! there arose up a loud cry for Ecclesiastical
Reform, and Gladstone, their Champion, arose up in the
house of St. Stephen’s, which is near unto Parliament
Square, and with stentorian lungs, said, I intend to go
the whole hog or none, and call upon the country to
dissolve the banns of matrimony between the aforesaid
Lion and Lawn Sleeves, which has so long been an eye-sore
to the country.</p>

<p>And, behold the words that Gladstone uttered sounded
like unto a death-warrant to the ears of Dizzey and his
pals, and his nose turned blue when he thought it was
U. P. with his greatness.</p>

<p>Now in due time the Great Election Battle took
place, and the Place-loving Tories, in spite of their
back-sliding capers, were dead licked; and Dizzey retired
to Buckinghamshire, and fasted for three whole
days, and sat up to his blessed chin in sackcloth and
ashes.</p>

<p>For the voice of the Country was with Gladstone, for
they knew well he was a Brick, and would hold the
balance justly between the rich and poor.</p>

<p>Now it was two days after St. Valentine, that the
Liberal Chief buckled on his armour, entered St. Stephen’s,
and prepared himself for the fight. And his
war-cry was “Justice to all men,” “Liberty to
Ireland,” and “Disendowment of the Irish Church.” And
the sons of the Land of Buttermilk, shouted, “More
power to you, Gladstone!”</p>

<p>And lo, the cry caused certain prelates to curtail their
shovel hats of their fair proportions and go into mourning,
by converting their silk aprons into hatbands, at
which the grunters nearly split their side with laughter.</p>

<p>And there arose a cry from the exiled sons of Erin,
which sank deep into the heart of noble Gladstone, and
with the battle-axe of Mercy struck off their fetters
and they were free!</p>

<p>And there was loud cries of “Long life to noble
Gladslone, the Liberator of the Land of Donovans!”</p>

<p>And Hardy the bosom friend of Poleaxe Dickey the
hero of Hyde Park, protested loudly against Gladstone
and his measure, and he and Dizzey wept bitter tears,
when they saw that they were licked.</p>

<p>And the land of donovans and buttermilk shouted,
No surrender, faugh o’ballagh! go it Gladstone, and the
Sandys danced tullochgorum round the rims of their
porridge-pots, and in whiskey, success to the Church
Bill.</p>

<p>Thus endeth the lesson for the day.</p>

<p class="center larger">LET US SAY.</p>

<p>From all Church monopoly, good Gladstone, save us.</p>

<p class="right">Save us, good Gladstone.</p>

<p>From being compelled to keep the fat shepherds of
every creed. Good Queen deliver us.</p>

<p class="right">Spare us, good Queen.</p>

<p>From maintaining such a large staff of idlers in silk
aprons and shovel hats, Friends of Reform, spare us.</p>

<p class="right">Friends of Reform, spare us.</p>

<p>From all undue taxes in the shape of tenths and
sucking pigs. Common sense, save us.</p>

<p class="right">Spare us our grunters, we beseech thee.</p>

<p>For the liberation of the exiled sons of Ireland, we
thank thee, good Gladstone!</p>

<p>In the name of the sons of Erin, we thank thee, oh,
Gladstone.</p>

<p class="right">Hear that, oh, Dizzey.</p>

<p>And now to Gladstone, the father of Reform, and
the friend of the people, be all thanks due both now
and for evermore, and success to the Irish Church Bill.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE</span><br />
<span class="larger">IRISH LAND QUESTION.</span></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In consequence of the gross mismanagement of John
Bull’s possessions at home and abroad, by unprincipled
servants and dishonest stewards; especially in the land
of St. Patrick, we have met together without distinction
to country or creed, to consider the best means of
alleviating the sufferings of that ill-used country.</p>

<p>When the down-trodden sons of Erin shall dig their
spades into their own native soil, free from the stone
and gravel of tyranny, then, and not till then, shall
the wrongs of Ireland cease.</p>

<p class="noindent">Friends and Fellow Countrymen,</p>

<p>The country calls us in divers places to reform abuses,
and assist the unemployed, by offering new gates of
labor, in place of those that have been most cruelly
shut at Woolwich and elsewhere, and although the old
saying says “Charity begins at home,” it is no reason
why we should forget our neighbour next door; therefore
I pray and beseech thee, oh! John Bull and Sandy,
to sympathise with poor Brother Pat, who for knocking
his shillaleigh a little too hard about the heads of the
varmint, was popped into quod till the Almighty will
of the people shall compel the Lords of St. Stephen’s to
let them go free.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Lesson for the Day is taken from one of the dark
pages of Irish History.</i></p>

<p>Now it came to pass when that renowned Irish
Champion, Brian O’Lynn, bequeathed his ghost to all
the wakes in Tipperary, behold there arose four kings
to suck up the best of the buttermilk and dance with
the prettiest girls in Ould Ireland.</p>

<p>Then arose a Royal Judas among them, who sold his
country to the Saxon Harry of Fair Rosamond
notoriety.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, after many years, Hooknosed
Billy the Dutchman, went over and deprived poor
Jamie Stuart of his rights.</p>

<p>And he cried aloud to his redcoats, Down with the
Spirit of Freedom! and eat up all the good of the land,
and let it be a refuge for foreigners, and let the children
of St. Patrick wander elsewhere.</p>

<p>Here endeth the Lesson.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Second Lesson is taken from the Irish Land
Question.</i></p>

<p>Now it is well known that the curse of Ireland or
any other country is “Land Monopoly,” especially in
our own country, where one man has thousands of
acres, and another poor fellow not enough whereon to
rest his aching bones.</p>

<p>For in the Emerald Isle the rich Landowner cries
aloud to his Steward, Steward! collect my rents in my
absence, who, instead of studying the prosperity of my
tenants am squandering away in debauchery and vice
the hard earnings of a poor and oppressed people.</p>

<p>Then the Agent answers, I must put money in my
purse, and straightway he cries aloud to his tenantry,
Lo, this is my master’s land and all that is thereon, pay
more rent or skedaddle, and make room for strangers
who are ready to pop into your place.</p>

<p>For the Irish land monopoly is like a landlord, who,
when he turns his tenant out of doors, stick to his
goods and furniture, saying, these are mine, are they
not on my premises?</p>

<p>Thus endeth the Lesson.</p>

<p class="center larger">LET US SAY,</p>

<p>Oh, Gladstone, Champion of Reform, and Friend of
the People, intercede for the poor Fenian prisoners.</p>

<p class="right">We beseech thee, oh, Gladstone.</p>

<p>Ye undaunted Champions of Ireland, Sullivan and
Moore, agitate for the poor Fenian prisoners.</p>

<p class="right">Agitate, oh, Patriots, we beseech thee!</p>

<p>To raise funds for the free emigration of our London
poor, tax the “Upper Ten,” we beseech thee, oh,
Lowe!</p>

<p class="right">Do, we beseech thee, there’s a good Lowe!</p>

<p>And, oh, most thrifty Chancellor, we pray thee to
reduce the pocket money of our Royal pensioners, for
it is hard to pluck the poor hard working-man’s pence,
and let the idle children of mammon go free.</p>

<p class="right">Hear that, oh, purple and fine linen!</p>

<p>And may it please your Majesty to grant a lease of
Buckingham Palace to the old and infirm Bishops of St.
Stephen’s, that they may take daily exercise in St.
James’s Park, fill their aprons with bread crumbs, and
reverently feed the ducks!</p>

<p class="right">Hear that, oh, Lawnsleeves?</p>

<p>And now to Gladstone, Bright, and Stuart Mill,
chosen of the people, let us render our thanks now and
for ever!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Amen.</span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_NEW_INTENDED" id="THE_NEW_INTENDED"></a>THE NEW INTENDED<br />
<span class="larger">REFORM BILL</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Which is expected to come into operation as soon as the Lords and Commons think fit.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first Clause in this new intended Act is relative
to Teetotalers. BE IT ENACTED:&mdash;That any
teetotaler who shall be known to drink more than three
gallons of cold water during the day, shall be chained
to the parish pump four hours, and pay two shillings
extra, in each quarter, water rate. So says the Reform
Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 2nd. Any young lady who shall wear a
crinoline more than twelve yards in circumference, or
containing more than thirteen steel hoops, shall pay 5s.
to the nearest hospital to where she resides to find
plasters for broken shins.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;Any workhouse-master who shall neglect to
skim the fat off the water in which thirty-six paupers
have been bathed, shall be forced to live upon skilly for
five days, and work for eight hours at the crank.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;Any lady over the age of seventy, who shall
drink more than three quarterns of gin before breakfast,
unless she shall be suffering from the cholic, shall
be kept without snuff for a fortnight.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;Any man who shall be known to get drunk,
and beat his wife more than once a day, shall be
compelled to sleep at the foot of the bed for one month;
and if that does not cure him, he shall be confined in
one of her Majesty’s Gaols till a reformation shall take
place.</p>

<p>6th.&mdash;And whereas we have received numerous
complaints that a great number of ladies’ pet dogs
having been found smothered in the mud that has been
swept up and left by the roadside, the commissioners
are requested to see that the said mud shall be carted
away at least once a week, especially in rainy weather.</p>

<p>7th.&mdash;Any woman who shall bring forth more than two
children at a birth, she will not be allowed to sleep
with her husband for two months, unless the head-board
shall be placed between them.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;And it having come under our notice, that many
respectable females have been much annoyed by second-hand
dandies’ and counter-jumpers puffing the smoke
in their faces from their penny pickwicks, the Reform
Bill enacts that such fops shall be compelled to pay
their last quarter’s washing bill, and wear an
unstarched dicky for six months.</p>

<p>9th.&mdash;And as we understand that many ladies
belonging to a class known as milliners’ assistants and
bonnet builders, having been frequenting different
music halls, and passing themselves off as ladies of
fortune, on purpose to lead young men astray. Be it
known to all whom it may concern, that if they do not
reform their ways they will have to pay 6d. per week
to the Baby clothing Association, and their mamma’s
will be made acquainted with their goings on.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;And as Reform is the order of the day, so
Reform your tailors’ bills. There is a clause set apart
for volunteers only:&mdash;it says that any rifle volunteer
found strutting about in a new uniform, shall be compelled
to produce two respectable persons not being
volunteers, to make oath that he has paid for the old
ones.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;Butchers will be compelled to reform their
ways, and cease to wag their chops about the steaks
being so dear on account of the cattle disease. And
butchers selling meat that has died of the scarlatina,
will be compelled to live upon bullocks’ liver and
sawdust for the space of three months.</p>

<p>12th.&mdash;Any policeman who shall be known to be
courting more than two cooks and three housemaids at
the same time, or be found with more than five pounds
of mutton in his possession, shall pay 2s. 6s. to the
Servants’ Aid Society, and not be allowed to look down
any area for three calender months.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;Any boy over the age of seven years, who
shall be found with a pea-shooter concealed about him,
shall be apprehended as a Fenian, and be debarred
from playing at cat for a fortnight.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;And as we have received intelligence that in
many parts of London there are lots of daring children
that have been found dancing to the tune of the Jolly
Butcher Boy, and Oh, Cafuzelum! thereby disturbing
the public peace, they will henceforth be considered as
dangerous members of society.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;And lately we have been much startled by
hearing that numbers of evil-disposed paupers in the
parishes of Marylebone, St. Luke’s and Chelsea, have
refused to crack stones at 1s. 3d. per yard, unless such
stones are parboild! A clause in the Beform Bill says
that such paupers who offend in the like manner, shall
be sentenced to penal servitude for one night in the
casual ward of Lambeth work-house that being the
heaviest sentence the law can inflict.</p>

<p>16.&mdash;And any cabman or ’bus-conductor are empowered
by the new Reform Bill to charge double fare
for any person or persons weighing over eighteen stone;
but no cabman shall charge more than one shilling over
and above his legal fare, excepting to Members of
Parliament or disorderly persons.</p>

<p>17.&mdash;No milkman will be allowed to mix more than
two gallons of water with one of milk, excepting when
the said milk is over-proof, and has a creamy
appearance.</p>

<p>18th.&mdash;And no baker shall employ any man who is
capable of eating more than four pounds of meat for his
dinner, as we have had many complaints about people’s
joints looking in a state of rapid consumption after
coming from the oven, as if they had taken to fretting.</p>

<p>19th.&mdash;And all persons contemplating suicide, are
earnestly requested not to drown themselves, as bodies
lying too long in the Thames cause the water to become
very unwholesome.</p>

<p>20th and last.&mdash;And by virtue of the Reform Bill,
any married couple who can prove that they have never
quarrelled since they were first married, will be entitled
to the blessings of universal suffrage.</p>

<p class="right">So says the Reform Bill.</p>

<p>8. Any Barber, or barber’s clerk, who when shaving
a customer shall cut more than one inch off the said

<p>10. Any Milliner, dress maker, or fast young girl

<p>11. Any puffing Grocer who shall be known to be

and forthwith be taken to Bedlam, or the nearest

<p>12. Any woman who shall be known to be gadding

<h3><a name="THE_NEW_STREETS_ACT" id="THE_NEW_STREETS_ACT"></a>THE NEW STREETS ACT.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">The First Clause in this truly farcical and singular Act
is relating to all ‘regular’ but not ‘running’ dustmen:&mdash;</p>

<p>That it be enacted that no dustman or scavenger shall
dare to sing out dust oh! in a falsetto voice, between the
hours of 10 in the morning and 7 in the evening; and
that all housekeepers or lodgers shall place all their cabbage
stumps, potatoe peels, or fish bones into a frying-pan,
dustpan, box or basket, chamber utensil, or any
other utensil that is at hand, and place them neatly
along the kerb, so that children may play at leap-frog
on their way to school.</p>

<p>2. That no persons shall under any pretence leave
any goods in the streets for more than sixteen seconds
and a half; and any baker resting his basket for a longer
space of time, shall for the first offence, forfeit his basket,
and for the second, be compelled to stand three hours in
a flour sack.</p>

<p>3. That no ox, pig, or ass, or any other kind of donkey
shall be driven through the streets without an order from
Scotland yard, or the Police Commissioners may detain
them for ther own use.</p>

<p>And it is enacted that on and after the first day of
November no cabman shall ply for hire, unless his cab
shall be illuminated; and moreover, it is expected that
each cabman shall be furnished with a transparent hat,
each hat to have a life-like photographic likeness of Sir
R&mdash; M&mdash; stuck in the centre.</p>

<p>4. That no ’bus driver or conductor shall allow more
than twenty-four volunteers to ride on the roof at one
time, and any female with a crinoline more than twelve
yards round shall not be allowed as an inside passenger;
and any person with more than thirteen stone of useless
fat, shall not be considered as a single fare. And it is
expected that each ’bus will be provided with a truck to
transport all such live lumber te their destination.</p>

<p>5. No walking sandwich will be allowed to parade
the streets, and no pavement to be disfigured with, ‘read
Fun or Tommyhawk.’ And any dandy seen strutting
about in one of Moses’s Guinea Overcoats, will be considered
as a walking advertisement, and will be punished
as the law directs. No play bills, show bills, sale bills,
nor bills of any kind be seen in the public streets, and
any quack doctor’s butler who shall be seen giving out
bills relative to extraordinary cures of incurable cures
shall be treated as a treasonable offender.</p>

<p>6. All carts, go-carts, or donkey carts, must keep a
correct line, at least four inches and a half from the kerb,
and all nursemaids who are seen out with a perambulator
with more than two soldiers as an escort, shall forfeit
their last quarter’s wages.</p>

<p>7. And be it enacted that any pug-dog, lap-dog,
poodle-dog, bull-dog, who shall be found lurking about
the street without being well muzzled, so as to prevent
them from picking up the stray bones; and such dogs
not giving their names and address to the police will be
treated as bad characters, and will be taken into custody,&mdash;that
is if the police can catch them&mdash;and be detained
until their parents or friends can be found.</p>

<p>8. And further that such dogs shall board and lodge
at the nearest station-house for three days free of expence,
and provided with such food a medical inspector shall
think fit, but if not owned at the end of that time they
shall be treated as outcasts and executed accordingly;
and their bodies sold for what they will fetch, the proceeds
to go towards a fund for the relief of decayed pie
shop keepers.</p>

<p>9. No shoeblack will be allowed to polish up your
understandings, nor use the words, “shine your boots,
sir,” without being duly licensed according to Act of
Parliament. And no costermonger, or costermonger’s
apprentice, shall dare to cry “ten a penny walnuts,”
within four feet of the footway; and any donkey braying
without an order from the Commissioners shall be taken
into custody, and fed upon cabbage stumps for one month.</p>

<p>10. With a view to suppressing all gaming, all betting
men are forbidden to meet more than three together in
public thoroughfares, but may victimise as many as they
like in the back streets.</p>

<p>11. No owners of soup or cook shops shall dare to
sell any stocking pudding that has not got at least two
plums and a half in a square inch, or they will be compelled
to swallow three quarts of double size every day
for a fortnight. No confectioner shall make or cause to
be made, any lollipops or sugar sticks measuring more
than six inches in length, and any children sucking any
of larger dimensions in the public streets will be considered
as causing an obstruction, and punished accordingly.</p>

<p>12. This Act is favourable to all cats as we find they
are not mentioned, so they are empowered to plunder
our cupboards, and seranade us with their nightly gambols
on the tiles.</p>

<p>13. No boy under twenty years of age will be allowed
to trundle a hoop upon the footpath, except between
the hours of twelve at night and six in the morning.</p>

<p>14. No lady after the passing of this Act must wear
a bonnet larger than the bottom of a halfpenny bun,
lest they should be afflicted with the brain fever, nor
have more hair sticking out behind than would stuff a
moderate side pillow-case.</p>

<p>15. No gent shall be allowed to wear whiskers that
shall extend more than four inches and a half from his
face under the pain of being close shaved with a carpenter’s
hand-saw.</p>

<p>16. And all mothers will be compelled to keep a
supply of soothing syrup on hand, as no child will
be allowed to cry during the prescribed hours; and this
Clause refers to all persons addicted to snoring, who are
hereby cautioned not to lay on their backs, for fear they
should disturb the public peace.</p>

<p>17. And as no one can be convicted unless seen by a
policeman, the public are requested to wait till that
gentlemen is out of sight before they violate any part
of this Act.</p>

<p>18. And as evil doers will be punished by Mayne
force, a placard to that effect will be stuck on each
lamp-post. So much for the New Police Act.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_POOR_LAW_CATECHISM" id="THE_POOR_LAW_CATECHISM"></a>THE POOR LAW CATECHISM.</h3>

<p>Q. What is your name?</p>

<p>A. A Pauper.</p>

<p>Q. Who gave you that name?</p>

<p>A. The Board of Guardians, to whom I
applied in the time of distress, when first I
became a child of want, a member of the
workhouse, and an inheritor of all the insults
that poverty is heir to.</p>

<p>Q. What did the Board of Guardians do
for you.</p>

<p>A. They did promise two things. First,
that I should be treated like a convicted felon,
being deprived of liberty, and on prison
fare. Lastly, that I should be an object of
oppression all the days of my life.</p>

<p>Q. Rehearse the Articles of thy belief.</p>

<p>A. I believe in the cruelty of Lord H&mdash;y
B&mdash;m, the author of the present Poor Law,
and I also believe that these laws have caused
the death of tens of thousands by starvation
and neglect.</p>

<p>Q. How many Commandments have you
and such as you are to keep?</p>

<p>A. Ten.</p>

<p>Q. Which be they?</p>

<p>A. The same which the Poor Law Commissioners
make in Somerset House, saying,
We are thy lords and masters, who have
caused thee to be confined as in bastiles, and
separated thee and the wife of thy bosom,
and the children of thy love. 1st, Thou
shalt obey no laws but ours. 2nd, Thou
shalt not make to thyself any substitute for
skilley, nor the likeness of tea, or any other
kind of food, or drink, except as is allowed
in the workhouse; for we are very jealous
men, punishing with severity any transgression
against our laws. Should’st thou disobey
in this, we shall teach you a lesson that shall
last thee all the days of thy life. 3rd, Thou
shalt labour hard, and for nothing, and none
of thy earnings shall be thy own. 4th, Remember
the Sabbath day: six days shalt
thou labour hard, and have but little to eat;
but the seventh day is the Sabbath, wherein
we cannot make you work, and so we give
you liberty for an hour or two, to save the
parish the expense of your Sunday dinner.
5th. Thou shalt honour the Poor Laws, the
Commissioners, and the Beadles; thou shalt
take no offence at what they say or do, or
else thy days shall be made more miserable
in the workhouse wherein thou livest. 6th,
Thou shalt commit murder by neglecting thy
starving children, for we will give thee
no assistance to get them food. 7th, Thou
shalt learn to neglect the dear ties of
nature, for we will separate thee from the
wife of thy bosom, and the children of thy
love. 8th, Thou shalt rob thyself of the
society and enjoyment of her whom thou
hast sworn to protect while life shall last.
9th, Thou shalt be a false witness whenever
a Pauper dies, and should the coroner or jury
ask you how you live, why tell them you live
like lords, and are as happy as princes. 10th,
Thou shalt covet all thy neighbour is possessed
of, thou shalt covet his friends, his
clothes, and all the comforts which thou
once had; yet shalt thou long in vain; for
remember, oh, pauper! that the motto of
every workhouse is&mdash;“He who enters here
leaves all comforts behind.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Question.</i> What is your name?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Soldier.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Who gave you that name?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The recruiting-sergeant, when I received the
enlisting shilling, whereby I was made a recruit of
bayonets, bullets, and death.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What did the recruiting-sergeant promise then
for you?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He did promise and vow three things in my
name. First, that I should renounce all idea of liberty,
and all such nonsense. Secondly, that I should be well
harassed with drill. And, thirdly, that I should stand
up to be shot at whenever called upon so to do; and I
heartily hope our Colonel will never call me into such
a perilous position.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Rehearse the Articles of thy Belief.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I believe in the Colonel most mighty, maker of
Sergeants and Corporals; and in his deputy the Major,
who is an officer by commission, and rose by turn of
promotion, suffered the hardships of the field-service,
marching and fighting; he descended into trials; after
the wars he rose again; he ascended into ease, and sitteth
on the right hand of the Colonel, from whence he
will come to superintend the good from the bad. I
believe in the Adjutant; the punishment of the guard-room;
the stopping of grog; the flogging with cats;
and the certainty of these things lasting. Amen.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How many Commandments may there be?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Ten.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are they?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The same which the Colonel spake in the standing
orders, saying, I am thy Colonel and commanding
officer, who commands thee in the field and in quarters.</p>

<p>I. Thou shalt have no other Colonel but me.</p>

<p>II. Thou shalt not make to thyself any sergeant or
corporal, that is in any European regiment above, or in
any Sepoy regiment below, neither shalt thou salute
them; for I thy Colonel am a jealous Colonel, and visit
the iniquities of my men unto the third and fourth
with stripes, and promote those who obey me and keep
my standing orders.</p>

<p>III. Thou shalt not take the name of thy Colonel in
vain, for I will not call him a good man who shall do
so.</p>

<p>IV. Remember that thou attend church parade. Six
days shalt thou have for drill and field-days; but on the
seventh day thou shalt have no drill, thou, nor thy fire-lock,
nor thy pouch, nor thy pouch-belt, nor thy
ammunition, or any of thy appointments: for six days
are sufficient for these things, and I like to rest on that
day; wherefore I order church parade&mdash;attend to it.</p>

<p>V. Honour thy Colonel and thy Major, that thy comfort
may be long in the regiment you are in.</p>

<p>VI. Thou shalt not get drunk on duty.</p>

<p>VII. Thou shalt not be absent from drill.</p>

<p>VIII. Thou shalt not sell thy kit.</p>

<p>IX. Thou shalt not come dirty to parade.</p>

<p>X. Thou shalt not covet thy pay-sergeants’s coat,
nor his place, nor his pay, nor his sword, nor his perquisites,
nor his wife, nor his authority, nor any thing
that is his.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What do you chiefly learn by these commandments?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I learn two things: my duty towards my Colonel,
and my duty towards my pay-sergeant.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is your duty towards your Colonel?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> My duty towards my Colonel is to believe in
him, to fear him, to obey all his orders, and all that are
put in authority under him, with all my heart; to
appear before him as a soldier all the days of my life;
to salute him, to submit to him in all respect whatever;
to put my whole trust in him, to give him thanks when
he promotes me, to honour him and his commission, and
to serve him as a soldier. Amen.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is your duty towards your pay-sergeant?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> My duty towards my pay-sergeant is to attend to
his directions, to look to him for pay and allowances,
and all supplies of clothing; to borrow four shillings
and give him five in return, to sign all books and papers
he may require, and to never doubt his word in any
thing.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Let me hear you say your prayers.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Our Colonel, high in rank, honoured be thy
name; may thy promotion come; thy will be done by
thy sergeants, corporals, and privates. Give me my
daily allowance of pay; and forgive me my crimes as I
should forgive my comrade soldier. And lead me not
to the triangles; but deliver me from them; and thine
shall be the honour, thine the power, for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What desirest thou in this prayer?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I desire my Colonel, our commanding officer, to
extend his kindness to me and all my comrades; that
we may honour him, serve him, and obey all his orders
as we ought to do. And I pray unto him that he will
be merciful unto us, and forgive us our crimes; and that
he will lead us on to the defence of our country and
Queen. And this I trust he will for his honour and
renown; and therefore I say, Amen, and Amen.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;What is your name?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Drunken Sot.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>&mdash;Who gave you that name?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>&mdash;As drink is my idol, landlords and their wives
get all my money; they gave me that name in my
drunken sprees, wherein I was made a member of strife,
a child of want, and an inheritor of a bundle of rags.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>&mdash;What did your landlords and landladies promise
for you.</p>

<p><i>A.</i>&mdash;They did promise and vow three things in my
name, first, that I should renounce the comfort of my
own fire side; secondly, starve my wife and hunger my
children; thirdly, walk in rags and tatters, with my
shoe soles going flip flap all the days of my life.</p>

<p><i>Catechist.</i>&mdash;Rehearse the articles of thy belief.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;I believe in the existence of one Mr Alcohol,
the great head and chief of all manner of vice, the
source of nine-tenths of all diseases; and I not only
believe, but am sure that when my money is gone and
spent, the landlord will stop the tap and turn me out.</p>

<p><i>C.</i>&mdash;How many commandments have ye sots to keep?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>&mdash;Ten.</p>

<p><i>C.</i>&mdash;What be they.</p>

<p><i>A.</i>&mdash;The same which the landlord and landlady spake
in the bar, saying, We are thy master and thy mistress
who brought thee out of the paths of virtue, placed thee
in the ways of vice, and set thy feet on the road which
leadeth to New South Wales.</p>

<p>I.&mdash;Thou shalt use no other house but mine.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;Thou shalt not make to thyself any substitute
for intoxicating drinks, such as tea, coffee, ginger-pop
and lemonade; for I am a jealous man, wearing the coat
that should be on thy back, eating thy children’s bread,
and pocketing the money which should make thee and
thy wife happy all the days of thy life.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;Thou shalt not use my house in vain.</p>

<p>IV.&mdash;Remember that thou eat but one meal on the
Sabbath day. Six days shalt thou drink and spend all
thy money, but the seventh day is the Sabbath, wherein
I wash my floor, mend my fires and make ready for the
company the remaining part of the day.</p>

<p>V.&mdash;Thou shalt honor the landlords, the landladies,
and the gin-shops with thy presence, that thy days may
be few and miserable, in the land wherein thou livest.</p>

<p>VI.&mdash;Thou shalt commit murder, by starving, hungering,
and beating thy wife and family.</p>

<p>VII.&mdash;Thou shalt commit self-destruction.</p>

<p>VIII.&mdash;Thou shalt sell thy wife’s and children’s
bread and rob thyself of all thy comforts.</p>

<p>IX.&mdash;Thou shalt bear false witness when thou speakest
of the horrors, saying, Thou art in good health when
labouring under the barrel fever.</p>

<p>X.&mdash;Thou shalt covet all thy neighbour is possessed
of; thou shalt covet his house, his land, his purse, his
health, his wealth, and all that he has got, that thou
mayest indulge in drunkenness, help the brewer to buy
a new coach, a pair of fine horses, a new dray, and a
fine building, that he may live in idleness all his days;
likewise to enable the landlord to purchase a new sign
to place over his door, with “Licensed to be drunk on
the Premises” written thereon.</p>

<h3><a name="NEW_BEER_HOUSE_ACT" id="NEW_BEER_HOUSE_ACT"></a><span class="larger">NEW BEER HOUSE ACT,</span><br />
To be observed by all Beer Sellers and Beer Drinkers throughout
England, and to be in force as long as the people will stand it.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now it has pleased the Lords spiritual and
temporal of this miscalled free and happy
England, to look with an eye of pity on the
working classes; and feeling for all those who
are fond of their beer, have passed a bill
called the New Beer House Act, and all
persons breaking the same will have to look
out for squalls.</p>

<p>Clause 1. Be it enacted, that any person
wishing to open a place for the sale of beer,
wine, ale, cider, or swankey, shall give notice
of the same to the overseers, churchwardens,
town crier, and parish beadle, of the parish
wherein he lives, and stick one on the door
of the church or chapel, if there is one, and
if not, he must pin one on the seat of his
breeches, and walk round the said parish from
ten in the morning till five in the afternoon,
for two consecutive Sundays, or live upon
skilly for one month.</p>

<p>2. Any person keeping a house for the
sale of any land of fermented liquor, and who
shall dare to keep the said house open one
moment after the clock has said cut it, and
sell one half pint of malt tea, he shall for the
first offence have his head shaved, and for
the second shall be imprisoned for a term
not exceeding his natural life.</p>

<p>3. Any keeper of any refreshment house
who shall have the cheek to sell, or cause to
be sold, one glass of cooper, or one quarter
of Watling’s pork feed to any person, without
being cock sure that his character is strictly
moral, he shall not draw another drop for 12
calendar months. This clause does not refer
to the tribe of Overend and Gurney’s, or any
one connected with the Albert Assurance
Company, or, in fact, any gentlemanly swindlers
whatever.</p>

<p>4. No chandler shop keeper, fruit shop
keeper, or shop for the sale of lollipops, shall
dare to sell small beer or shandy-gaff to any
wayfarer during the hours stated in the act,
or they will have to pay 40s., and forfeit the
swankey for Her Majesty’s own private use.</p>

<p>5. It is enacted that a body of vigilant
officers from each, division of police to be called
the tasters, whose duty shall be to enter such
houses as they may think fit, swallow all
they can find, and see that none of the working
classes get half seas over.</p>

<p>6. All brewers’ grooms, or draymen, shall
sponge their horses on Saturday night, lest
they should smell of malt on the Sunday.</p>

<p>7. All persons who are in the habit of getting
tight on Saturday night, are requested to
drink one quart of half-and-half before closing
time, lest they should be thirsty next morning.</p>

<p>8. All persons who have a custom of taking
a stroll into the country on a Sunday to get
a blow after their week’s labour, or enjoy a
picnic at Hampstead or Wimbledon, will do
well to provide themselves with stone bottles,
labelled cold tea, as there will be no such a
thing as bona-fide travellers while the new
Beer House Act is in force.</p>

<p>9. All persons are forbidden to use any
bottles, jugs, glasses, or tea cups that has
contained beer on Saturday night, without
well scalding out on the Sunday morning.</p>

<p>10. And woe betide any woman who is
caught with a flask containing cholic drops
in her pocket.</p>

<p>11. All cowkeepers or dairymen are cautioned
against feeding their cows on grains, lest
the milk should give the tea a beery flavour.</p>

<p>12. All publicans and beer shop keepers
are to place a wet blanket over their chimney
pots, close the windows, and stop up the
key holes, lest the smell should offend the
framers of the New Beer House Act.</p>

<p>13. Any person who receives a visit from
father, mother, brother, or grandmother,
during the prescribed hours, they must not
dare to give them one glass, they not being
servants or lodgers.</p>

<p>And lastly, any person causing the conviction
of one score of offenders against the
above Act, will receive, as a reward, a free
admission to the Crystal Palace at the next
meeting of the Temperance League.</p>

<p>So says the New Beer House Act.</p>

<div class="verse">As some heroes bold, I will unfold, together were conversing,</div>
<div class="verse">It was in the praise of Nelson, as you shall quickly hear;</div>
<div class="verse">Said one unto the other, if we could behold another,</div>
<div class="verse">In old England like Nelson, we proudly would him cheer.</div>
<div class="verse">From Norfolk it is known he came, he was a man of noted fame,</div>
<div class="verse">He struggled hard for liberty, as every Briton knows,</div>
<div class="verse">In battle he would loudly cry, I’ll gain the victory or die,</div>
<div class="verse">This grand conversation on brave Nelson arose.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now at Copenhagen and the Nile, he gave command with a smile,</div>
<div class="verse">He said, “Stand firm, my British tars, the enemy to meet;</div>

<div class="verse">The champion of the briny waves was Nelson and his fleet;</div>

<div class="verse">Many a youth, I’ll tell the truth, in action have been wounded</div>

<div class="verse">Others never returned again, but died upon the raging main,</div>
<div class="verse">Causing many a one to cry “my son” and widows to deplore,</div>
<div class="verse">When war was raging, it is said, men for their labour were paid,</div>
<div class="verse">Commerce and trade flourishing, but now it ebbs and flows,</div>
<div class="verse">And poverty it does increase, though Britons say we live in peace,</div>
<div class="verse">This grand conversation on brave Nelson arose.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some hardy tars they did survive, in Greenwich College now alive,</div>
<div class="verse">Will tell the deeds of Nelson and the battles that he won,</div>
<div class="verse">He never feared a cannon ball, till at Trafalgar he did fall,</div>
<div class="verse">No flinching from the enemy&mdash;no action he did shun;</div>
<div class="verse">He many powers did defeat, and never was that hero beat,</div>
<div class="verse">Neither would he surrender till he had thrashed his daring foes,</div>
<div class="verse">Altho’ he lost an eye and wing, he was loyal and true to his king,</div>
<div class="verse">This grand conversation on brave Nelson arose.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Trafalgar I will mention, if you will give attention,</div>
<div class="verse">It long has been recorded where brave Nelson fell and bled,</div>
<div class="verse">The officers around him, all human aid was found,</div>

<div class="verse">The gallant tars were grieved sore to find Lord Nelson was no more,</div>
<div class="verse">All was in confusion in the ’midst of dying woes,</div>
<div class="verse">In rum they put him, it is said, and then to England him conveyed,</div>

<div class="verse">Now in mem’ry of that hero’s loss, we understand at Charing Cross,</div>

<div class="verse indent2">And for me it will not be a lark.</div>
<div class="verse">Now don’t go says Walley, to you I declare,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Against us you know they’ve a spite,</div>
<div class="verse">The people mean business, so I shan’t go there,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Not in Hyde Park, on that Monday night.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In busses the Poleaxes hurried along,</div>
<div class="verse">And when they arrived they were five thousand strong,</div>
<div class="verse">But during the night you couldn’t see one,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Interfere with our friends in Hyde Park.</div>
<div class="verse">I heard that one said to his mate, “Bill, I say,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">If they have a row, I’ll be off quick,</div>
<div class="verse">For I got in a bother the last reform day,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And they measured my head with a brick.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now Government frightened on Monday they were,</div>
<div class="verse">Some constables special in then they did swear,</div>
<div class="verse">Their staffs they did hide, when in the Park there,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">They thought that they would have to fight.</div>
<div class="verse">One went home enraged, says he, “I’ll have a row&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Since to Hyde Park I’ve been on the march,</div>
<div class="verse">I am almost a boiling&mdash;we have been I vow,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Like dummies stuck on the Marble Arch.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So the Franchise for ever, we’ve beat them, hurra!</div>
<div class="verse">Long life to brave Beales, and Reformers, I say,</div>
<div class="verse">United let’s be, and we’ll yet gain the day,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And always remember Hyde Park.</div>
<div class="verse">We do not want <span class="smcap">SPECIAL</span> duty to be done,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Our rights! it is all that we ask,</div>
<div class="verse">To meet with each other when labour is done,</div>

<div class="verse">If we are to be governed, let us cry far &amp; wide,</div>
<div class="verse">Let us be governed well, ’tis an Englishman’s pride,</div>
<div class="verse">And not have disturbance and bloodshed besides,</div>
<div class="verse">On this, our own dear native land.</div>
<div class="verse">Then let us have Justice, we do not want more,</div>
<div class="verse">We ask for our wives and our homes,</div>

<div class="verse">The Fenians are coming,&mdash;oh, don’t things look queer?</div>
<div class="verse">The land of old Erin looks bashful and blue,</div>
<div class="verse">Colonel Catchem and General Doodlem doo,</div>
<div class="verse">Has crossed the Atlantic, poor Erin to sack,</div>
<div class="verse">And carry Hibernia away on their back.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">There’s a rumpus in Ireland by night and by day,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Pop goes the weazel, and shoot goes the gun,</div>
<div class="verse">While over the mountains the Fenians do run;</div>
<div class="verse">As a regiment of soldiers did after them jog,</div>
<div class="verse">Four hundred and fifty fell into a bog!</div>
<div class="verse">The best of the fun was&mdash;the soldiers did shout,</div>
<div class="verse">We have got in a mess, and we cannot get out!</div>
<div class="verse">When a funny old woman so nimbly flew,</div>
<div class="verse">And collared great General Doodlem-doo.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some could not fire, and some could’nt run,</div>
<div class="verse">One carried a reap-hook, another a gun,</div>
<div class="verse">They tried to kill nobody, just for a spree,</div>
<div class="verse">So they both went together to cut down a tree;</div>
<div class="verse">There was a young lady, her name it was Peg,</div>
<div class="verse">She’d one eye and two noses, one arm and one leg,</div>
<div class="verse">March on, lads, she shouted, to glory we’ll steer,</div>
<div class="verse">The Fenians are coming, oh dear, oh dear!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some with big stones and brickbats their pockets did fill,</div>
<div class="verse">They thought of the battle of great Bunker’s Hill,</div>
<div class="verse">Cut away, fire away, go along Pat,</div>
<div class="verse">A soldier fired at a Fenian, and shot a tom cat;</div>
<div class="verse">Old Molly Maloney, up her chimney did creep,</div>
<div class="verse">Over the hills and the mountains she had a good peep,</div>
<div class="verse">While under her window the bagpipes did play,</div>

<div class="verse">What do you think of the Fenians? said Kit, in a joke,</div>
<div class="verse">Why, says Nell, it will end in a bottle of smoke,</div>
<div class="verse">Thousands over the mountains, like grasshoppers flew,</div>
<div class="verse">Be aisy, cried General Doodlem-doo:</div>
<div class="verse">Colonel Catch’em commanded, had a hump on his back,</div>
<div class="verse">Shoot away, fire away, philliloo whack,</div>
<div class="verse">Then a jolly old fiddler from famed Mullingar,</div>
<div class="verse">Struck up the bold anthem of Erin-go-bragh.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The soldiers one night when the bugle did sound,</div>
<div class="verse">That night going over the mountains they found,</div>
<div class="verse">A cat and a donkey, a pig and a dog,</div>

<div class="verse">While down at Killarney, ’twas fire away whack,</div>
<div class="verse">At the glorious battle of herrings and sprats!</div>
<div class="verse">And although they fought without trousers or shirt,</div>
<div class="verse">I think they were really more frightened than hurt.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Cheer up, says old Barney, here comes the police:</div>
<div class="verse">Here’s old Erin and glory, plum pudding and peace,</div>
<div class="verse">A glass of good whiskey twice every day,</div>
<div class="verse">That is better than fighting and running away!</div>
<div class="verse">As for me, my dear boys, if a row I was in it,</div>
<div class="verse">I’d rather run for a mile than fight for a minute;</div>
<div class="verse">And I would advise all to have done with such capers,</div>
<div class="verse">And just stay at home to look after the taters.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Old Dennis Mahoney got up in a tree,</div>
<div class="verse">His musket was loaded with skillagalee,</div>
<div class="verse">Blood-an-ouns, said old Denny, I’m a Fenian, here goes,</div>
<div class="verse">He fired, and shot two policemen under the nose;</div>
<div class="verse">The bough of the tree with old Dennis soon broke,</div>
<div class="verse">And Dennis came down like a pig in a poke.</div>
<div class="verse">He died as he fell, and he whistled, oh la!</div>
<div class="verse">Singing, farewell for ever, old Erin-go-bragh.</div>

BALLADS ON A SUBJECT.</h2>

<p class="center">“What hast here, ballads? I love a ballad in print; for then we are sure they are true.”&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Street Ballads on a Subject.</span>”&mdash;There is a class of ballads which may with perfect propriety be called <i>street</i> ballads, as they are
written by street authors for street singing and street sale. These effusions, however, are known in the trade by a title appropriate enough,&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Ballads
on a Subject</span>.” The most successful workers of this branch of the profession are the men described as patterers and chaunters.</p>

<p>The “Ballads on a Subject” are always on a political, criminal, or exciting public event, or one that has interested the public, and the
celerity with which one of them is written, and then sung in the streets, is in the spirit of “these railroad times.” After any great event
“a ballad on a subject” is often written, printed, and sung “in honour,” it was announced “of Lord John Russell’s resignation.” Of course
there is no time for either correction of the rhymes or of the press; but this is regarded as of little consequence,&mdash;while an early “start” with
a new topic is of great consequence, I am assured; “Yes, indeed, both for the sake of meals and rents.” If, however, the songs were ever so
carefully revised, their sale would not be greater.</p>

<p>It will have struck the reader that all the street lays quoted as popular have a sort of burthen or jingle at the end of each verse. I was
corrected, however, by a street chaunter for speaking of this burthen as a jingle. “It’s a chorus, sir,” he said. “In a proper ballad on a
subject there’s often twelve verses, none of them under eight lines, and there’s a four-line chorus to every verse; and, if it’s the right sort,
it’ll sell the ballad.” I was told, on all hands, that it was not the words that ever made a ballad, but the subject, and, more than the subject,&mdash;the
chorus; and, far more than either,&mdash;<i>the tune</i>! Indeed, many of the street-singers of ballads on a subject, have as supreme a contempt
for words as can be felt for any modern composer. To select a tune for a ballad, however, is a matter of deep deliberation. To adapt
the ballad to a tune too common or popular is injudicious; for then, I was told, any one can sing it&mdash;boys and all. To select a more elaborate
and less-known air, however appropriate, may not be pleasing to some of the members of “the school” of ballad-singers who may feel it
beyond their vocal powers; neither may it be relished by the critical in street songs, whose approving criticism induces them to purchase as
well as to admire.</p>

<p>The license enjoyed by the court jesters, and in some respects by the minstrels of old, is certainly enjoyed, undiminished, by the street
writers and singers of ballads on a subject. They are unsparing satirists, who, with rare impartiality, lash all classes and all creeds, as well
as any individual. One man, upon whose information I can rely, told me that, many years ago, he himself had “worked” in town and
country, twenty-three different songs at the same period and the same subject&mdash;the Marriage of the Queen. They all “sold”&mdash;but the most
profitable was one “as sung by Prince Albert in character.” It was to the air of “Dusty Miller;” and “it was good,” said the ballad-man,
“because we could easily dress up to the character given to Albert. And what’s more, sir,” continued my informant, “not very long after
the honeymoon, the Duchess of L&mdash;&mdash; drove up in her carriage to the printer’s, and bought all the songs in honour to Victoria’s wedding,
and gave a sovereign for them and wouldn’t take the change. It was a Duchess. Why I’m sure about it&mdash;though I can’t say whether it were
the Duchess of L&mdash;&mdash; or S&mdash;&mdash;; for didn’t the printer, like an honest man, when he’d stopped the price of the papers, hand over to
us chaps the balance to drink, and <i>didn’t</i> we drink it! There can’t be a mistake about <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>The “Ballads on a Subject” are certainly “the rude uncultivated verse in which the popular tale of the times is recorded,” and what may
be the character of the nation as displayed in them, I leave to the reader’s judgment.&mdash;<i>Henry Mayhew’s London Labour and the London Poor.</i></p>

<p>The writer of an able article in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, 1867, on “The Poetry of Seven Dials,” remarks that ‘Our next section of
‘Modern Events’ is characterised throughout by such a general sameness of treatment as to need few examples by way of illustration. They
are clearly written, for the most part hastily, on the spur of the moment; and though they may command a good sale at first, they do so not
by the wit, beauty, or aptness of the verse, but by the absorbing interest of the calamity which it describes. Thus, say, an appalling accident
happens in London; the news spreads like wildfire throughout the city, and gives rise to rumours, even more dreadful than the reality.
Before night it is embalmed in verse by one out of five or six well-known bards who get their living by writing for Seven Dials, and then
chanting their own strains to the people. The inspiration of the poet is swift, the execution of the work rapid,&mdash;how rapid may be
judged from the following fact. On Thursday, February 21, a woman named Walker was brought before the magistrate and charged with
robbing Mr. F. Brown, her master, a publican, to whom she had offered her services as a <i>man</i>. She was sent to prison, and there her sex was
discovered. The next morning, at 10 a.m., two men and two women were singing her personal history and adventures in the New Cut, to a
large but not select audience, under the title of ‘The She Barman of Southwark.’ It was great trash, but sold well&mdash;but the pay for such
work is small. ‘I gets a shilling a copy for my verses’ (says one), ‘besides what I can make by selling ’em.’ But the verses are ready and
go to press at once. A thousand or two copies are struck off instantly, and the ‘Orfle Calamity’ is soon flying all over London from the
mouths of a dozen or twenty minstrels, in the New Cut, in Leather Lane, Houndsditch, Bermondsey, Whitechapel, High Street, Tottenham-court-road&mdash;or
wherever a crowd of listeners can be easily and safely called together. If the subject admits of it, two minstrels chant
the same strain</p>

<p class="noindent">each taking a line in turn, and each vying with the other in doleful tragedy of look and voice. A moment suffices to give out in
sepulchral accents, ‘Dreadful Accident this day on the Ice in Regent’s Park,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>“These Halfpenny Sheets form almost the entire poetry of Seven Dials, and though they teach little or no history, they show, at least,
what kind of poetry finds the most favourable reception and the readiest sale among our lowest classes. As far as we can ascertain, there are
in London eight or ten publishers of the Fortey and Disley stamp&mdash;though not on so large a scale. Of ballad-singers and patterers of prose
recitations (such as the ‘Political Catechism’), there may be about a hundred scattered over the metropolis, who haunt such localities as the
New Cut, Tottenham-court-road, Whitechapel, and Clerkenwell Green; and according to the weather, the state of trade, and the character of
their wares, earn a scanty or a jovial living by chanting such strains as we have now laid before our readers. ‘Songs if they’re over religious,’
says one minstrel, ‘don’t sell at all; though a tidy moral does werry well. But a good, awful murder’s the thing. I’ve knowed,’ says our
authority, ‘a man sell a ream a day of <i>them</i>.&mdash;that’s twenty dozen you know;’ and this sale may go on for days, so that with forty or fifty
men at work as minstrels, a popular ballad will soon attain a circulation of thirty or forty or fifty thousand. Now and then the publisher
himself composes a song, and in this case is saved the cost of copyright, though his expenses are very trifling, even when he has to purchase
it. If one of the patterers writes a ballad on a taking subject, he hastens at once to Seven Dials, where, if accepted, his reward is ‘a glass of
rum, a slice of cake, and five dozen copies,’&mdash;which, if the accident or murder be a very awful one, are struck off for him while he waits. A
murder always sells well, so does a fire, or a fearful railway accident. A good love story, embracing</p>

<p class="noindent">often does fairly; but politics among the lowest class are a drug. Even the famous <i>Ballad on Pam’s death didn’t do much</i> except among the
better sort of people; and though the roughs are fond of shouting <i>Reform</i>, they don’t care, it would seem, to spend money on it.”</p>

<p>We have submitted this wretched doggrel to our readers, that they may form some idea of the kind of Street Literature which is still
popular with so many of the lower classes. It is humiliating, in the midst of all the schools and teaching of the present day, to find such
rubbish continually poured forth, and eagerly read. Still there are some redeeming features in this weary waste. <i>Taken as a whole</i>, the
moral tone of the ballads, if not lofty, is certainly not bad; and the number of single stanzas that could not be quoted in these pages on
account of their gross or indecent language is very small; while that of entire Ballads, to be excluded on the same ground, is still smaller.</p>

<p>Well Mother Sprightly, what do you think
of this Female Husband; it appears to me a
strange piece of business. Why, Mother
Chatter, I do not believe half what is said
about it&mdash;Pho, pho, do you think I would
have been in bed with my husband twenty-one
minutes without knowing what he was
made of, much more twenty-one years, for I
should never have patience to wait so long.
My old man cuddles me as close as wax these
cold winter nights, and if he was to turn his

<div class="verse indent2">All struggled for their lives in the water.</div>
<div class="verse">The cries of the people, as they stood upon the shore,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To witness such a scene most distressing,</div>
<div class="verse">Some clung to each other, but now are no more,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In grief are the friends of the missing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">What must have been the feelings of those standing by,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Unable to save and madly raving?</div>
<div class="verse">The women rushed about, and bitterly did cry,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">My children, my children, oh save them!</div>
<div class="verse">Wives calling to their husbands,&mdash;children, father dear,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But few that were able to assist them,</div>
<div class="verse">Now all will miss their own, for them shed a tear,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Kind fathers, the children will miss them.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They clung to the ice, until benumbed with cold,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The ice in their grasp broke asunder;</div>
<div class="verse">One lady on the shore, in grief did behold</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Her husband, exhausted, go under;</div>
<div class="verse">Two sisters were screaming and calling for aid,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Their sorrow, poor girls, could not smother,</div>
<div class="verse">In anguish wrung their hands, and franticly said,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For God’s sake save my poor brother.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The most mournful part remains to be told,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">As the bodies to the dead-house were taken,</div>
<div class="verse">At the workhouse gate two thousand young and old,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The scene it was truly heart-breaking;</div>
<div class="verse">One body was owned by an old gentleman,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">My son can’t be dead, he said, while crying,</div>
<div class="verse">He left me but two hours, was strong and cheerful then,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For a father so old it’s very trying.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The doctors did their best in saving many lives,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Of those that were in this sad disaster;</div>
<div class="verse">Officials one and all, Mr Douglas and his wife,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Long life to that kind workhouse master.</div>
<div class="verse">A poor faithful dog saw his master disappear,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And never left the park since that evening,</div>
<div class="verse">No food will he take, by the water stays near,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For it’s master the poor dog is grieving.</div>

<div class="verse">Oh, dear! what a rumpus and bother,</div>
<div class="verse">From one end of England right bang to the other,</div>
<div class="verse">The lawyers their wigs pelted one at the other,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Young Windham has conquered them all.</div>
<div class="verse">They swore he was mad, that he acted quite funny,</div>
<div class="verse">Imitated the cat, and stood just like a dummy,</div>
<div class="verse">The fact was, you see, that they wanted his money,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But now the old soldier is licked.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, dear! what can the matter be?</div>
<div class="verse">Swearing and humbugging, jawing and flattery,</div>
<div class="verse">They may now go and hang themselves up to an apple tree,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Young Windham has conquered them all.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Before there was never such pulling and tearing,</div>
<div class="verse">The tales that was told was really unbearing,</div>
<div class="verse">Such bawling, such pushing, such talking, &amp; swearing,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To prove that young Windham was mad.</div>
<div class="verse">Because he thought proper to marry a wife, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">Because he was happy and cheerful through life, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas money, the money, that caused the strife, sir,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But young Windham has conquer’d them all.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sometimes he would Mackney be imitating,</div>
<div class="verse">I wish I was with Nancy! he oft would be stating,</div>
<div class="verse">In the Strand, in the Strand! as I am relating,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And then they all swore he was mad.</div>
<div class="verse">Because on the engine he went fast and slow, now,</div>
<div class="verse">And with the ladies he used for to go now,</div>
<div class="verse">Then holloa like winking, Bob Ridley, O! now,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Well, but that wouldn’t make him be mad.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Not far from St. James’s some coveys were dwelling,</div>
<div class="verse">They such wonderful tales to the jury was telling,</div>
<div class="verse">And there was a lot that was named Llewellin,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Who spun a most wonderful yarn.</div>
<div class="verse">That sometimes he was naked, &amp; drunk too, I vow, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">That he crowed &amp; moll rowed, &amp; kick’d up a row, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">And wetted sometimes the back part of his trousers,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And they swore to be sure he was mad.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now young Windham has conquered them all, and is right, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">He may fight, drink and sing, be enjoying his pipe, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">And he with his money can do as he likes, sir,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He has licked the old soldier right well.</div>
<div class="verse">The weeping old soldier is beat, he is done, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">He may slip on his knapsack and follow the drum, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">Or march thro’ the country, and shoulder his gun, sir,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It’s a chance if he doesn’t go mad.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Through all the set speeches of Montague Chambers,</div>
<div class="verse">If he carried the day we should all be in danger,</div>
<div class="verse">They’d have made us all mad, and there’s nothing more stranger,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But into the madhouse we’d go!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, the money, the money, they wanted the money,</div>
<div class="verse">And that was the thing made the parties feel funny,</div>
<div class="verse">There was rough tales, and smooth tales, and tales told like honey,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But it didn’t make young Windham go mad.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Here’s success to the jury who acted so clever,</div>
<div class="verse">Do you think they’d be bias’d, oh no, they would never,</div>
<div class="verse">Drink their health in a bumper, may they live for ever,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And we hope they will never go mad.</div>
<div class="verse">When the trial was over, young Windham not fear’d them,</div>
<div class="verse">And the public as soon as ever they near’d him,</div>
<div class="verse">Hurrah’d him right well, and so heartily cheer’d him,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And declar’d that he never was mad.</div>

<div class="verse">Oh have you heard the jolly row,</div>
<div class="verse">In London all around, just now,</div>
<div class="verse">If not, I’ll tell you all, I vow,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It is the strike of the Journeymen Tailors</div>
<div class="verse">The masters and the men you see,</div>
<div class="verse">They cannot very well agree,</div>
<div class="verse">The masters they won’t alter the log,</div>
<div class="verse">The men say they shall, so help their bob;</div>
<div class="verse">The masters say the men are wrong,</div>
<div class="verse">But the men say they are too strong,</div>
<div class="verse">So I suppose they must settle it themselves among,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">This strike of the journeymen Tailors,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The sleeveboard and goose may idle lay,</div>
<div class="verse">The needle and bobkin is stowed away,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, is there not the devil to pay,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thro’ the strike of the Journeyman Tailors</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now ever since the world began,</div>
<div class="verse">They say nine tailors makes a man,</div>
<div class="verse">But do without them they never can,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The host of the Journeymen Tailors.</div>
<div class="verse">For indebted to their work ’tis clear,</div>
<div class="verse">Is kings and dukes, and lords and peers,</div>
<div class="verse">They are wanted here, and wanted there,</div>
<div class="verse">And all they want is to play fair.</div>
<div class="verse">And they must get it, these men of stitches,</div>
<div class="verse">Or what shall we do for coats and breeches,</div>
<div class="verse">We must black and go naked, or hide in ditches</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thro’ the strike of the Journeymen Tailors.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now the tailors are of ancient date,</div>
<div class="verse">Believe it’s true, what I now state,</div>
<div class="verse">And I’ll tell you the time if you’ll only wait</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When the world was first blessed with a tailor</div>
<div class="verse">The first there was, tho’ I never see’d him,</div>
<div class="verse">Had his workshop in the garden of Eden,</div>
<div class="verse">And I tell you he was not a green ’un,</div>
<div class="verse">Tho’ he grew lots of cabbage to feed on;</div>
<div class="verse">He stitched away when the world began,</div>
<div class="verse">And made fig leaf togs, A No. 1,</div>
<div class="verse">He was a regular Flint, and never a Dung,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It was Adam, the first of the tailors.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">What we shall do, I do not know,</div>
<div class="verse">If the men to work they will not go,</div>
<div class="verse">We shall walk about just like scarecrows,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thro’ the strike of the Journeymen Tailors.</div>
<div class="verse">We shall be all rags and jags,</div>
<div class="verse">And only fit for the ragman’s bags,</div>
<div class="verse">Or to make a sign for some rag shop,</div>
<div class="verse">With just enough left to make a mop;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh wont it be a funny go,</div>
<div class="verse">To see the swells in Rotton Row,</div>
<div class="verse">With their shirt tails flying in the wind, as they go,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thro’ the strike of the Journeymen Tailors.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">An old lady the other day did run,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the shop of Moses and Son,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, please Mr Mo, are you a Dung;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Don’t you know there’s a strike with the tailors!</div>
<div class="verse">Then round the corner she did pop,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, is this not a sweating shop,</div>
<div class="verse">Then he holloa’d police, but it was no use,</div>
<div class="verse">For she flattened his nose with a ten pound goose,</div>
<div class="verse">Now they tell me the sleeveboards looked quite big,</div>
<div class="verse">And round old &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; they danced a jig,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, we shall have a rest, so please the pigs</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thro’ the strike of the Journeymen Tailors.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now let us hope we soon shall see,</div>
<div class="verse">The masters and the men agree,</div>
<div class="verse">For fair play is the style for me,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With all classes, as well as the tailors.</div>
<div class="verse">If they don’t go in, I do declare,</div>
<div class="verse">We soon shall have no breeches to wear,</div>
<div class="verse">But that my friend is only a joke,</div>
<div class="verse">So, if I offend, I am sorry I spoke.</div>
<div class="verse">We all for the biggest shilling fight,</div>
<div class="verse">And I think you will own that I am right,</div>
<div class="verse">But jolly good luck I say, blow me tight,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To the whole of the Journeymen Tailors.</div>

<div class="verse">All you that dwell in Lambeth, listen for awhile,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To a song to enlighten and amuse you,</div>
<div class="verse">In the workhouse only mark, there’s queer doings after dark.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And believe me it is true I now tell you;</div>
<div class="verse">It’s of the ups and downs, of a pauper’s life,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Which are none of the best you may be sure, sir.</div>
<div class="verse">Strange scenes they do enact, believe me, it’s a fact,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In Lambeth workhouse among the casual poor, sir.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh my, what a rummy go, oh crikey, what a strange revelation,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Has occurred in Lambeth workhouse a little while ago,</div>
<div class="verse">And through the parish is causing great sensation.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now a gent, with good intent, to Lambeth workhouse went,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The mystery of the place to explore, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">Says he, without a doubt, I shall then find out,</div>

<div class="verse">So he went through his degrees, like a blessed brick,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thro’ scenes he had never seen before, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">So good luck to him, I say, for ever and a day,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For bestowing a thought upon the poor, sir.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Says he, when you go in, in a bath you are popt in,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To flounder about just like fishes,</div>
<div class="verse">In water that looks like dirty mutton broth,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Or the washings of the plates and the dishes;</div>
<div class="verse">Then your togs are tied up tight, to make sure all is right,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Like parcels put up for a sale, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">A ticket then you get, as if you are for a trip,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And a-going a journey by the rail, sir.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then before you go to bed, you get a toke of bread,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Which, if hungry, goes a small way to fill you,</div>
<div class="verse">And if not too late at night, you may chance to be all right,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To wash it down with a draught of skilley;</div>
<div class="verse">Some they will shout out, Daddy, mind what you are about,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And tip me a comfortable rug now,</div>
<div class="verse">And be sure you see it’s whole, for I’m most jolly cold,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And mind you don’t give us any bugs now.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then you pig on a dirty floor, if you can, you’ll have a snore,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And pass away time till the morning.</div>
<div class="verse">Then you’re muster’d up pell mell, at the crank to take a spell,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Just to give your cramp’d up body a good warming.</div>
<div class="verse">Then see them all in rows in their torn and ragged clothes,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Their gruel and their bread they swallow greedy,</div>
<div class="verse">Then through London streets they roam, with neither friends or home,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It’s the fate of the suffering and the needy.</div>

<div class="verse">Now a word I’ve got to say, to all you who poor rates pay,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Tho’, of course, offence to none is intended,</div>
<div class="verse">Before you your poor rates pay, just well look to the way,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And inquire how your money is expended;</div>
<div class="verse">Do as you’d be done to, that is the time of day,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And with me you’ll agree, I am sure now,</div>

<div class="verse">So listen to me and a tale you shall hear,</div>
<div class="verse">Some hundreds each night flock to Woburn Square,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To just get a peep at the Ghost</div>
<div class="verse">Great consternation it has caused all around,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And each one to his neighbour declares,</div>
<div class="verse">Have you seen the Ghost that each night is found</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A dancing round Woburn Square.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They toddle along, the lame and the blind,</div>
<div class="verse">The deaf and the dumb they will not stay behind,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, to Woburn Square, hasten lads, let’s be in time,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And have a good look at the Ghost.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some say that his Ghostship that walks there at night,</div>
<div class="verse">It is Mrs. Chang the Chinaman’s wife,</div>
<div class="verse">And some say it’s Muller again come to life,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To look for the cabman his friend.</div>

<div class="verse indent2">And he’ll stand a good chance, so help my bob,</div>

<div class="verse">But whoever he is he is togg’d all in white,</div>
<div class="verse">And such antics he plays in the square every night,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a long scaffold pole he stands bolt upright,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">This naughty Ghost of Woburn Square,</div>
<div class="verse">As large as the soup plates is his glaring eyes,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The sight of which puts you in dread,</div>
<div class="verse">He’s a smart little fellow about ten feet high,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With a monstrous donkey-like head.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He escaped from St. Pancras churchyard I hear,</div>
<div class="verse">Not liking the company he had got there,</div>
<div class="verse">He stalks out at night just to take the fresh air,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And get a drop for to moisten his clay;</div>
<div class="verse">He is not at all quarrelsome you must allow</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For the devil a word does he speak,</div>
<div class="verse">But when he is tired his Ghostship I vow</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In a jiffey he beats a retreat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The women did holloa, the boys they did shout,</div>
<div class="verse">Mr. Ghost, how’s your mother, does she know you’re out?</div>
<div class="verse">The peelers was sent to put them to the rout,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And clear them away from the square.</div>
<div class="verse">They collared some boys, but the Ghost was not found,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Though they looked for him everywhere,</div>
<div class="verse">And some will remember the time I’ll be bound&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The Ghost’s visit unto Woburn Square.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In my time I have heard queer ghost stories told,</div>
<div class="verse">How through keyholes they’d pop in the days of old,</div>
<div class="verse">But I can’t think men such fools to come out in the cold,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">On purpose the people to scare;</div>
<div class="verse">So if it’s a live ghost playing a trick,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And you can his Ghostship come near,</div>
<div class="verse">The best way to pay him is with a thick stick,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And he’d never trouble again Woburn Square.</div>

<div class="verse">Mary Newall is a nice yound girl,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">She possessed herself of riches,</div>
<div class="verse">In the Vauxhall Road she crack’d the crib</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And put on the pegtop breeches.</div>

<div class="verse">She turned the house near inside out,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Indeed I am no joker,</div>
<div class="verse">She cut the hair from off her head,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And stuck it on the poker.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She got a lot of bullock’s blood,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And mixed up in a pail, Sir,</div>
<div class="verse">So to think that I am murdered, now</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Master will not fail, Sir;</div>
<div class="verse">She smashed the poker right in two,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That no one should doubt it,</div>
<div class="verse">With a bit of glue, now this is true,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">She stuck the hair about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She in the wainscoat cut a hole,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Just the size of a man, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">She smashed a window from the inside,</div>

<div class="verse">Crack a crib with any chap,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And back up all the riches,</div>

<div class="verse">With new spring boots, &amp; fine cloth vest</div>

<div class="verse indent2">With boxes in rotation,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, Cabby, old boy, as quick as you like,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Drive off to Shoreditch Station.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">Now her master soon returned home,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The truth I do declare, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying the house is rob’d and Mary’s dead,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Here’s the poker cover’d with hair, sir</div>
<div class="verse">To the station-house he quick did send,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Murder and robbery, who could doubt it,</div>

<div class="verse indent2">Soon told them all about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The telegraph was set to work,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The best thing for to track her,</div>
<div class="verse">It was soon found she at Yarmouth was</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A smoking of her tobacco;</div>
<div class="verse">Drest up in slap togs, you’re sure,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Like the greatest swells of the day,</div>
<div class="verse">She got dead nuts on her landlady,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And took her to the play.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sheen, the detective, soon found her out</div>

<div class="verse indent2">Was walking with the girls, sir</div>

<div class="verse">To the Magistrate she was brought up,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Strange things every day we hear.</div>
<div class="verse">So one and all pray draw near,</div>
<div class="verse">Of a strange trial you shall hear,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Concerning life in a Convent.</div>
<div class="verse">In Hull, as I to you will tell,</div>
<div class="verse">Within a Convent I did dwell,</div>
<div class="verse">A Mother, as you know well,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And a Sister of Mercy.</div>
<div class="verse">Her name is Starr, as I now state,</div>
<div class="verse">She’s a perfect star, and no mistake,</div>
<div class="verse">So I will tell you if you will wait,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">How they treated a Nun in a Convent.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now the trial is o’er, and the Judge did say</div>
<div class="verse">Mistress Starr, you have lost the day,</div>
<div class="verse">And five hundred pounds you’ll have to pay</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For tricks that are play’d in the Convent.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now this Nun’s name it is S&mdash;&mdash;n,</div>
<div class="verse">Who wished to lead a life serene,</div>
<div class="verse">And has for years an inmate been,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And led a nice life in the Convent.</div>
<div class="verse">For Mrs. Starr&mdash;that merciful mother&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">In her some faults would oft discover,</div>
<div class="verse">And led her a life, a regular drudger,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When she was in the Convent.</div>
<div class="verse">This Nun she could do nothing right,</div>
<div class="verse">She was always wrong, both day and night,</div>
<div class="verse">To be a Nun is’nt nice,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">How happy they live in a Convent!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She made her on her knees to go,</div>
<div class="verse">Black-lead the stoves, scrub the floor,</div>
<div class="verse">Empty them things the name I don’t know,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And that’s what she did in a Convent.</div>
<div class="verse">She dare not keep thimble, cotton, or rag,</div>
<div class="verse">Her clothes were not fit for a bone-picker’s bag,</div>
<div class="verse">And would make her walk about, isn’t it sad,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When she was in the Convent.</div>
<div class="verse">If she snored in bed that was not right,</div>
<div class="verse">Or picked gooseberries that was not ripe,</div>
<div class="verse">This duck of a mother led her a fine life.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Oh, who would live in a Convent?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If she dared to write, or too loud speak,</div>
<div class="verse">Or if of grub too much did eat,</div>
<div class="verse">She must lay for a month without blanket or sheet,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Oh, that was a treat in a Convent!</div>
<div class="verse">Mrs. Starr said she once met her with a ham</div>
<div class="verse">And her mouth was like turkey’s crammed,</div>
<div class="verse">And she said, sister, what are you at,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I declare your mother is smothered in fat,</div>
<div class="verse">Did you ever see such an hungry glutton,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon sawdust you must be put on,</div>
<div class="verse">You put away ham if you’re baulk’d of mutton,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Said kind Mother Starr of the Convent.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When her stocking was the Judge before,</div>
<div class="verse">He said they’re old, I’m certain sure,</div>
<div class="verse">Why they’ve been well patched behind and before,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Is that what they wear in a Convent?</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, said the Nun, and it is a great scandal,</div>
<div class="verse">She says grease is dear, and I must not use candle,</div>
<div class="verse">And as for the grub I could’nt handle,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Whilst I was in the Convent.</div>
<div class="verse">It would puzzle Old Nick with her to agree,</div>
<div class="verse">And as for mercy, small share she gave me,</div>
<div class="verse">So I think my Lord Judge, you plainly may see,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It’s no joke to live in a Convent.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So ladies all, don’t think it a sin,</div>
<div class="verse">If your husband at night you can’t keep in,</div>
<div class="verse">Send for Mrs. Starr, and bundle him in,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And give him a month in a Convent;</div>
<div class="verse">He’ll miss his wife to tuck in the clothes,</div>
<div class="verse">To make him gruel and tallow his nose,</div>
<div class="verse">For one dose will cure him I do suppose,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">If he only gets in a Convent.</div>
<div class="verse">Now you young lasses, my song is near done,</div>
<div class="verse">And I would advise you everyone,</div>
<div class="verse">To ask Mrs Starr to make you a Nun,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And have a peep at her Convent!</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If the chignons were gathered, it would be a treat</div>
<div class="verse">To see them made use of for pitching the street,</div>
<div class="verse">Or perhaps they would do, either black, red, or brown,</div>
<div class="verse">To fill up the quaries about the &mdash;&mdash; Downs:</div>

<div class="verse">And tell &mdash;&mdash; enemies to look out for squalls,</div>

<div class="verse">Come all you hearty roving blades, and listen to my song,</div>
<div class="verse">A verse or two I will unfold, and will not keep you long,</div>
<div class="verse">It is of a frolicsome parson, as you shall quickly hear,</div>
<div class="verse">That dwelt in the town of Ledbury, in the county of Herefordshire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The parson being a rakish blade, and fond of sporting games,</div>
<div class="verse">He fell in love with the pretty cook, as I have heard the same;</div>
<div class="verse">The parlour-maid found out the same, and in the fruit room looked,</div>
<div class="verse">And there she saw the parson sporting with the cook.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It was in nine months after she brought him forth a child,</div>
<div class="verse">Within the rectory it was born, it drove him nearly wild:</div>
<div class="verse">It proved to be a male child, at least they tell us so,</div>
<div class="verse">Then this damsel from the rectory was quickly forced to go.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then the secret to unfold, it was her full intent,</div>
<div class="verse">During the time of service into the church she went,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding the child up in her arms, and on the parson gazed,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, lovely babe, that is your dad, which filled him with amaze.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The congregation they all stared, the parson seemed confused,</div>
<div class="verse">And many a lad and lass no doubt, within them felt amused;</div>
<div class="verse">Such a scene as this was never known within this church before,</div>
<div class="verse">Let us hope that it will be the last, and the like shall be no more.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">’Twas then a court was called in town, for to invest the case.</div>
<div class="verse">There the parson, cook, and parlour-maid they met face to face,</div>
<div class="verse">And many more in court appeared, to hear the sport and fun,</div>
<div class="verse">This damsel swore the parson was the father of her son.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Your reverence; you are found to blame the Justices declared,</div>
<div class="verse">Although some honest country lad you thought for to ensnare;</div>
<div class="verse">So with all your doctrine and your skill unto him they did say,</div>
<div class="verse">A half-a-crown each week to the child you’ve got to pay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">His reverence felt dissatisfied with such a glorious treat,</div>
<div class="verse">To a higher court he did proceed, and there was quickly beat,</div>
<div class="verse">So this damsel she’s victorious, the truth I now declare,</div>
<div class="verse">And his reverence is suspended for the period of five years.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Come all you blooming servant maids a warning take by this,</div>
<div class="verse">When in service with the parsons don’t be treated to a kiss;</div>
<div class="verse">Or it may cause much jealousy, as you may all well know,</div>
<div class="verse">Then you from service must be gone your sorrows for to rue.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now to conclude and make an end and finish up my song,</div>
<div class="verse">All you young men that’s deep in love, be sure don’t stay too long;</div>
<div class="verse">Join hand in hand in wedlock’s band without the least delay,</div>
<div class="verse">Before the fairest of all girls is by parsons led astray.</div>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="center">“There’s nothing beats a stunning good murder after all.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Experience of a Running Patterer.</span></p>

<p>Of accounts of Public Executions, Dying Speeches, and Confessions we have those before us, stretching from the Execution of Sir
John Oldcastle in 1417, to the Trial and Execution of F. Hinson, who suffered the extreme penalty of the law, at the Old Bailey, Monday,
December 13th, 1869, for the wilful murder of Maria Death, to which is attached the all-important and necessary “Copy of Verses,” and
by way of supplement, we add a <i>verbatim</i> copy of the Full, True and Particular Account of the Execution of J. Rutterford, at Bury St.
Edmunds, for the murder of J. Hight, with copy of “Death-verses.” But the convict was NOT hanged after all. As the gaol surgeon
having reported that Rutterford had a malformation which might cause an unusual degree of suffering on death being inflicted by strangulation,
whereupon the Secretary of State for the Home Department ordered a special examination to be made by some medical men of the
immediate neighbourhood, and on whose report the sentence of death previously recorded was commuted to transportation for life!</p>

<p>All the modern examples of <span class="smcap">The “Gallows” Literature of the Streets</span> come not only from different printers and publishers, but from
distant towns,&mdash;London, Birmingham, Lincoln, and Preston, but they have all the same stamp. And the whole of the last dying speeches
and confessions, trials, sentences from what ever part of the country they come, run in the same form of quaint and circumstantial detail,
appeals to heaven, to young men, to young women, to christians in general, and moral reflections. The narrative, embracing trial,
biography, &amp;c., is usually prepared by the printer, being a condensation from the accounts in the newspapers. It is then necessary to add
the “copy of verses.” Many of these are clearly by the same hand, probably one of the five or six well-known authors, who also chaunt
their own verses in the streets. And with regard to this matter&mdash;“Time being the essence of the contract,”&mdash;it must also be noted that
many of the most popular “Death-verses” being composed on the spur of the moment for the purpose of being sung while all the town is
ringing with the event, all niceties of rhyme, metre, and orthography have to be utterly disregarded. “I gets,” says one of the fraternity,
“I gets a shilling a copy for the verses <i>written by the wretched culprit</i> the night previous to his execution.” “And I,” says another, “did
the helegy on Rush. I didn’t write it to horder; I knew that they would want a copy of verses from the wretched culprit. And when the
publisher read it; ‘that’s the thing for the streets,’ he says. But I only got a shilling for it.” “It’s the same poet as does ’em all,” says
a third authority, “and the same tip: <i>no more nor a bob for nothing</i>.” This was paltry pay under any circumstances, but still more so
when we find that in the case of the chief modern murders these “Execution Ballads” commanded a most enormous sale, thus:</p>

<p>So that the printers and publishers of “Gallows” Literature in general, and “The Seven Dials Press” in particular, must have reaped
a golden harvest for many a long day, even when sold to the street-folks at the low rate of 3d. per <i>long</i> dozen. Mr. W. S. Fortey, the
successor of the late celebrated Jemmy Catnach, stated to us during a recent conversation with him on the sale number of modern dying
speeches. “Well, <i>I</i> never in <i>my</i> time printed so many as <i>I</i> did of the Five Pirates of the Flowery Land, and <i>I</i> sold them at the rate of
3,000 copies per hour, and did altogether 90,000,&mdash;that was my share. What the others did of course I can’t say. I know I got a new
machine out of the job!&mdash;which we now call the “Pirates,” or sometimes “The Flowery Land.”<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mr. Fortey furthermore informed us
that his share of the “Execution Papers” of recent popular murders was as follows:&mdash;Müller, 84,000; Constant Kent, 15,000; Jeffery,
10,000; Forward, 5,000. Mr. Fortey’s trade announcement runs thus:&mdash;“The Catnach Press.” (Established 1813.) William S. Fortey,
(late A. Ryle), successor to the late J. Catnach, Printer, Publisher, and Wholesale Stationer, 2 and 3, Monmouth Court, Seven Dials,
London, W.C. The cheapest and greatest variety in the trade of large coloured penny books; halfpenny coloured books; farthing books;
penny and halfpenny panoramas; school books; penny and halfpenny song books; memorandum books; poetry cards; lotteries; ballads
(4,000 sorts) and hymns; valentines; scripture sheets; Christmas pieces; Twelfth-night characters; carols; book and sheet almanacks;
envelopes, note paper, &amp;c., &amp;c. W. S. Fortey begs to inform his friends and the public generally, that after 19 years’ service, he has
succeeded to the business of his late employers (A. Ryle and Co.), and intends carrying on the same, trusting that his long experience
will be a recommendation, and that no exertion shall be wanting on his part to merit a continuance of those favours that have been so
liberally bestowed on that establishment during the last 46 years.</p>

<p>As far as can be ascertained, the sale of Broad-sheets in the Mannings and Rush’s case far exceed that of any now before us. Even
that of Müller did not amount to more than two hundred and eighty thousand copies&mdash;though no modern murder ever surpassed it in
atrocity, or in the profound interest which it excited throughout England. And this difference is no doubt to be explained by the fact that
since Mannings and Rush’s day the daily penny newspapers have almost forestalled the “Dying Speeches and confessions”&mdash;with or without
the “copy of verses”&mdash;by giving a full account of the different enormities in all their minute and hideous details. The force of public
opinion, too, thus exerted through the Press, has been brought to bear on the question of crime, and much of the morbid sympathy which found
expression in the case of such a monster as Rush, had died away in 1864, when detectives tracked Müller across the Atlantic, and brought
him back to be hanged by an English hangman, in the presence of an English mob. To every one of the murderers, Constance Kent at
Road hill house, Jeffery, Forward, at Ramsgate, and the Pirates of the “Flowery Land,”&mdash;one and all alike,&mdash;stern justice is meted out
with inflexible severity. The wretched girl who at Salisbury confessed her crime to the judge, makes no excuse for her guilt, but tells only
of the intolerable remorse that would give her no rest&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My infant brother so haunted me,</div>
<div class="verse">I not one moment could happy be;</div>
<div class="verse">And if for the murder they do me try,</div>
<div class="verse">I declare I’m guilty, and deserve to die.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Scoundrels,” “malefactors,” “villains,” are the gentlest names for this Newgate gallery, and the gallows in every case is promised, with
a sort of grim satisfaction that augurs strongly for a deep popular belief in the justice of those solemn words, “Whoso sheddeth man’s
blood, by man shall his blood be shed.”</p>

<p>With the recent Act of Parliament abolishing the execution of criminals in sight of the public. Halfpenny and penny newspapers,
and the capriciousness of Home Secretaries, the Dying Speech trade has in its turn received its death-blow. Still old memories and
customs yet cling to the “Affectionate Copy of Verses.”&mdash;“The (cooked) Love Letters” and “Confessions”&mdash;made only by the
Street-Patterer, and are found sufficiently remunerative to author, printer, publisher, and vendor&mdash;But for <span class="smcap">This Day Only</span>!</p>

<p>The following is the style of “gag” and “patter” of a man formerly well-known in the
“Dials” as “Tragedy Bill”&mdash;“Now, my friends, here you have, just printed and published, a
full, true, and pertickler account of the life, trial, character, confession, behaviour, condemnation,
and hexecution of that unfortunate malefactor, Richard Wilbyforce, who was hexecuted on Monday
last, for the small charge of one ha’penny, and for the most horrible, dreadful, and wicked murder
of Samuel&mdash;I means Sarah Spriggens, a lady’s maid, young, tender, and handsome. You have here
every pertickler, of that which he did, and that which he didn’t. It’s the most foul and horrible
murder that ever graced the annals of British history(?) Here, my customers, you may read his
hexecution on the fatal scaffold. You may also read how he met his victim in a dark and lonesome
wood, and what he did to her&mdash;for the small charge of a ha’penny; and, further, you read how he
brought her to London,&mdash;after that comes the murder, which is worth all the money. And you
read how the ghost appeared to him and then to her parents. Then comes the capture of the
<i>willain</i>; also the trial, sentence, and hexecution, showing how the ghost was in the act of pulling
his leg on one side, and the ‘old gentleman’ a pulling on the other, waiting for his victim (my
good friends excuse my tears!) But as Shakspeare says, ‘Murder most foul and unnatural,’ but
you’ll find this more foul and unnatural than that or the t’other&mdash;for the small charge of a ha’penny!
Yes, my customers, to which is added a copy of serene and beautiful werses, pious and immoral, as
wot he wrote with his own blood and skewer the night after&mdash;I mean the night before his hexecution,
addressed to young men and women of all sexes&mdash;I beg pardon, but, I mean classes (my friends
its nothing to laugh at), for I can tell you the werses is made three of the hard-heartedest things
cry as never was&mdash;to wit, that is to say namely&mdash;a overseer, a broker, and a policeman. Yes, my
friends, I sold twenty thousand copies of them this here morning, and could of sold twenty thousand
more than that if I could of but kept from crying&mdash;only a ha’penny!&mdash;but I’ll read the werses.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Who was Hang’d as a Traytor, and Burnt as a Heretick.</i></p>

<p>At the beginning of the reign of Henry V.,
about the year 1413, the anger of the clergy was
excited against the <i>Lollards</i>, and they fabricated a
report of a pretended conspiracy among them, headed
by Sir John Oldcastle, or, as he was called by courtesy,
Lord Cobham, in his wife’s right.</p>

<p>Lord Cobham has the honour of being the first
author and the first martyr among the nobility of
England. He was a man of considerable natural
abilities, proficient in literature, of a ready wit, and
skilled in the affairs of the cabinet or in the field. In
his love for philosophy, he had perused the writings of
Wickliffe, and in so doing unconsciously absorbed the
leaven of evangelical and spiritual religion. When
persuaded of the truth of those doctrines he enrolled
himself as a disciple, and did all in his power for their
spread, both by his gifts and personal efforts. He
transcribed the works of Wickliffe; he supported various
preachers, and became the acknowledged leader of the
rising reformation. The hostility of the church was,
of course, an inevitable result.</p>

<p>Sir John being convicted of heresy, the Archbishop
waited upon the King, and gave him an account
of the proceedings against him, and moved his Majesty
that the execution might be respited for 50 days, which
was readily granted by the King, as well as the Archbishops,
being desirous to preserve Sir John Oldcastle.</p>

<p>Sir John before the fifty days expired, made his
escape out of the Tower, and endeavoured to secure
himself by making an insurrection. To this purpose
he wrote letters to his friends, to engage their Party,
and make them ready for the Field, to surprise the
King, and overturn the Government.</p>

<p>The King being apprised of the danger, on the
6th of January, 1414, removed from Eltham to his
palace at Westminster, but without any appearance of
alarm. The Rebels were just upon the execution of
their design, being drawn together by Sir John Acton,
Knight, John Brown, Esq., and John Beverly, a priest,
in Ficket-field, on the backside of St. Giles’s; hither
they came in the dead of night, expecting to join their
General, Sir John Oldcastle.</p>

<p>The King came into the field before Day, where
several of the Rebels, mistaking their party, fell in
with the King’s forces; and it being demanded whither
they were going, they answered, to my Lord Cobham.
The King, to prevent their getting together, had ordered
the City Gates to be shut and guarded, without which
precaution ’tis thought the Londoners would have
reinforced their party to a very formidable body, but
being disappointed of this succour they soon dispersed,
and several of them were killed or taken prisoners.
And the King set a thousand Marks upon Sir John
Oldcastle’s head, with a promise of great Privileges to
any town that should deliver him up. An Indictment
of High Treason was found against Sir John in the
King’s Bench, for conspiring the Death of the King,
the Subversion of the Established Religion and Government,
and Levying War, whereupon he was outlawed.</p>

<p>Sir John Oldcastle was near being surprised in
the neighbourhood of St. Alban’s, at a farmhouse
belonging to the Abbot of that town, <i>anno</i> 1417; for
the Abbot being informed Sir John lay concealed at one
of his Tenants, sent some of his servants, in the night,
to beset the house, and though they missed of Sir John,
they seized some of the principal men of his party.
They found also several religious Books, adorned with
paintings, which the <i>Lollards</i> esteeming superstitious,
cut off the Heads of the Figures, and also erased the
Names of the Saints out of the litanies; they also
found scandalous Papers in Dishonour of the blessed
Virgin. These Books were sent over to the King into
Normandy, and by him returned to the Archbishop.</p>

<p>Upon the occasion the <i>Lollards</i> were loudly
disclaimed against at St. Paul’s Cross, and a tragical
Representation made of the Matter, and not long after
Sir John Oldcastle was taken in Powis Lands in Wales.
He stood upon his Defence, fought those that came to
apprehend him, and refused to surrender his Person till
he was wounded and disabled.</p>

<p>Sir John Oldcastle having been outlawed upon
an Indictment for High Treason, for that he with divers
others called <i>Lollards</i>, to the number of Twenty
Thousand, had assembled themselves at <i>St. Giles’s in
the Fields</i>, levyed War, and conspired the Death of the
King and the Subversion of the Religion and Government
established, and standing also excommunicated for
Heresy, he was brought before the Parliament on the
18th of December, 1417, and it being demanded what
he had to say why Execution should not be awarded
against him according to Law, he ran out into a Discourse
foreign to the matter, concerning the Mercy of
God, &amp;c., whereupon the Chief Justice required him to
answer directly, if he had anything to object against
the Legality of the Process; he replyed, <i>he could not
own them for his judges, as long as his Sovereign Lord</i>
King Richard <i>was living in Scotland</i>. Upon this
Answer a Rule was made for his Execution, <i>viz.</i>, That
he should be carried back to the Tower, and from thence
drawn through London to the New Gallows at St.
Giles’s in the Fields, and there be hanged, and burnt
hanging, which Sentence was executed with Rigour.
He was hanged as a Traytor, and burnt as a Heretick.</p>

<h3 class="hanging"><a name="The_DYING_SPEECHES_BALLARD" id="The_DYING_SPEECHES_BALLARD"></a>The DYING SPEECHES and EXECUTION of John Ballard, priest; Anthony Babington,
Esq.; John Savage, Gent.; Robert
Barnwell, Gent.; Chidiock Titchborne,
Esq.; Charles Tilney and Edward Abington,
Gent. (Seven of the Conspirators
against Queen Elizabeth) for High Treason</h3>

<p>On the 20th of September, 1586, a Gallows being
set up on purpose in St. Giles’s Fields, where they
us’d to meet, these seven were drawn thither to their
Execution.</p>

<p>John Ballard, the Priest, the principal Conspirator,
confess’d, that he was guilty of those things for
which he was condemned, but protested they were
never enterprised by him upon any hope of preferment,
but only, as he said, for the advancement of true
Religion. He craved pardon and forgiveness of all
persons, to whom his doings had been any scandal, and
so made an end; making his prayers to himself in
Latin, not asking her Majesty forgiveness, otherwise
than if he had offended.</p>

<p>Anthony Babington, Esq., also confessed, That he
was come to die, as he had deserved; howbeit that he
(as Ballard before) protested that he was not led into
those actions upon hope of preferment, or for any
temporal respect; nor had ever attempted them. For
his wife, he said, she had good friends, to whose consideration
he would leave her: And thus he finished,
asking Her Majesty forgiveness, and making his prayers
in Latin.</p>

<p>John Savage, Gent., confessed his guilt, and said (as
the other two before) that he did attempt it, for that in
conscience he thought it a deed meritorious, and a
common good to the weal publick, and for no private
preferment.</p>

<p>Robert Barnwell, Gent, confessed that he was made
acquainted with their Drifts, but denied that ever he
consented, or could be in conscience persuaded that it
was a deed lawful. I crave forgiveness; if the sacrifice
of my body might establish her Majesty in the true
religion, I would most willingly offer it up. Then he
prayed to himself in Latin.</p>

<p>Chidiock Titchbone, Esq., began to speak as followeth,
<i>viz.</i>, Countrymen and my dear Friends, you expect I
should speak something; I am a bad Orator, and my
text is worse: It were in vain to enter into the
discourse of the whole matter for which I am brought
hither, for that it hath been revealed heretofore, and is
well known to the most of this company; let me be a
warning to all young gentlemen, especially <i>generosis
adolescentulis</i>. I had a friend, and a dear friend, of
whom I made no small account, whose friendship hath
brought me to this; he told me the whole matter, I
cannot deny, as they had laid it down to be done; but
I always thought it impious, and denied to be a dealer
in it; but the regard of my friend caused me to be a
man in whom the old proverb was verified; I was
silent, and so consented. Before this thing chanced,
we lived together in most flourishing estate; of whom
went report in the Strand, Fleet street, and elsewhere
about London, but of Babington and Titchbone? No
threshold was of force to brave our entry. Thus we
lived, and wanted nothing we could wish for; and God
knows, what less in my head than matters of State?
Now give me leave to declare the miseries I sustained
after I was acquainted with the action, wherein I may
justly compare my estate to that of Adam’s, who could
not abstain one thing forbidden, to enjoy all other
things the world could afford; the terror of conscience
awaited me. After I consider’d the dangers whereinto
I was fallen, I went to Sir John Peters, in Essex, and
appointed my horses should meet me at London, intending
to go down into the country. I came to London,
and there heard that all was bewrayed; whereupon,
like Adam, we fled into the woods to hide ourselves,
and there were apprehended. My dear countrymen,
my sorrows may be your joy, yet mix your smiles with
tears, and pity my case. This done, he prayed first in
Latin, and then in English, asking Her Majesty, and
all the world, heartily, forgiveness, and that he hoped,
stedfastly, now at this his last hour, his faith would not
fail.</p>

<p>Charles Tilney said, I am a Catholick, and believe in
Jesus Christ, and by his Passion I hope to be saved;
and I confess I can do nothing without him, which
opinion all Catholicks firmly hold. He prayed in Latin
for himself, and after he prayed for Queen Elizabeth,
that she might live long; and warned all young gentlemen,
of what degree or calling soever, to take warning
by him.</p>

<p>Edward Abington said, I come hither to die, holding
all points firmly that the Catholick Church doth; and
for the matters whereof I am condemned, I confess all,
saving the death of Her Majesty, to the which I never
consented. He feared, as he said, great bloodshed in
England before it were long.</p>

<p>Ballard was first executed. He was cut down and
bowell’d with great cruelty while he was alive.
Babington beheld Ballard’s execution without being in
the least daunted; whilst the rest turned away their
faces, and fell to prayers upon their knees. Babington
being taken down from the gallows alive too, and ready
to be cut up, he cried aloud several times in Latin.
<i>Parce mihi Domine Jesu</i>, spare or forgive me O Lord
Jesus! Savage broke the rope, and fell down from the
gallows, and was presently seized on by the Executioner,
his privities cut off, and his bowels taken out while he
was alive. Barnwell, Titchborne, Tilney, and Abington
were executed with equal cruelty.</p>

Jones, John Charnock, John Travers,
Robert Gage, Jerome Bellamy, for High
Treason, the 21st of September, 1586.
Being drawn to the place of Execution.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thomas Salisbury, Esq., since it hath
pleased God to appoint this place for my
end, I thank his infinite goodness for the
same; I confess that I have deserved death,
and that I have offended her Majesty, whom
to forgive me I heartily beseech, with all
others whom I have any way offended; I
desire all true Catholicks to pray for me,
and I desire them, as I beseech God they
may, to endure with patience whatsoever
shall be laid upon them, and never to enter
into any action of violence for remedy.
Thus done, he cried in English and Latin,
Father, forgive me.</p>

<p>Henry Donn, Yeoman, said, Do the people
expect I should say anything? I was
acquainted, I confess, with their practices,
but I never did intend to be a dealer in
them: Babington oftentimes requested me
to be one, and said, for that he loved me
well, he would bestow me in one of the best
actions; which should have been the delivery
of the Queen of Scots, to which I could not
for a long time agree; at length, by many
urgent persuasions he won me, so as I told
him I would do my best: And being asked,
as he was ascending the ladder, whether he
thought it lawful to kill her Majesty: He
answered, No, no. No soul was more
sorrowful than his, nor none more sinful;
and prayed for her Majesty, wishing she
might live in all happiness, and after this
life, be eternized in everlasting bliss; and
so he prayed in Latin and English.</p>

<p>Edward Jones said, I come hither to die,
but how rightfully God knows; for thus
stands my case: At Trinity Term last, Mr
Salisbury made me acquainted with their
purposes; and for that he knew me to be
well horsed, he thought me as fit as any to
attempt the delivery of the Queen of Scots,
and requested me to be one; which I utterly
denied, altogether misliking their practices,
and persuading him, by what means I might,
from it; and told him, this was the haughty
and ambitious mind of Anthony Babington,
which would be the destruction of himself
and friends, whose company I wished him
to refrain; and for that I would have him
out of his company; I have divers times
lent him money, and pawned my chain and
jewels to buy him necessaries to go into the
country, and so concluded with his prayers,
first in Latin, and then in English, that the
people might better understand what he
prayed.</p>

<p>John Charnock and John Travers having
their minds wholly fixt on prayer, recommended
themselves to God and the Saints.
Gage extolled the Queen’s great grace and
bounty to his father, and detested his own
perfidious ingratitude towards his Princess.
And Jerome Bellamy, with confusion and
deep silence, suffered last.</p>

<p>The Queen being informed of the severity
used in the executions the day before, and
detesting such cruelty, gave express orders
that these should be used more favourably;
and accordingly they were permitted to hang
till they were quite dead before they were
cut down and bowell’d.</p>

<h4>THEIR CHARACTERS.</h4>

<p>The Conspirators were most of them
gentlemen of good families, whom nothing
but the specious pretence of religion could
probably have prevailed upon to turn affairs.</p>

<p>The history of the plot in which Ballard, Babbington, Tichbourne, and others, were
engaged in 1586, is well known. The subsequent ballad, by the celebrated Thomas Deloney,
(his initials T.D. being at the conclusion of it) was no doubt printed immediately after the
execution of the “fourteen most wicked traitors,” on the 20th and 21st September. At the
top of the broadside are woodcuts of fourteen heads, but they are not likenesses, but merely
engravings which the printer happened to have in his possession, and which had been already
used for Hill’s work on Physiognomy, and perhaps for other publications requiring illustrations.&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3><a name="THE_EXECUTION_OF_LUKE_HUTTON" id="THE_EXECUTION_OF_LUKE_HUTTON"></a>THE EXECUTION OF LUKE HUTTON.</h3>

<p>A tract by Luke Hutton, of which there were two editions, the first without date, and the last in 1638, is very well known, and an
account of it may be found in the Bridgewater Catalogue, (privately printed for Lord Francis Egerton) p. 149. Hence it appears also
that Hutton was the author of an earlier production, called his “Repentance.” He seems to have been a highwayman and house-breaker,

<h3><a name="EXECUTION_OF_THE_CONSPIRATORS" id="EXECUTION_OF_THE_CONSPIRATORS"></a>EXECUTION OF THE CONSPIRATORS.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">On Thursday, the 30th of January, 1605, Sir Everard Digby, Robert Winter, John Grant,
and Thomas Bates, were executed at the West End of St. Paul’s; and the next day,
January 31, Thomas Winter, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keyes, and Guido Fawkes, were
executed in the Old Palace Yard, over against the Parliament House, Westminster,
Conspirators in the Powder Plot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prisoners, after their condemnation and judgment,
being sent back to the Tower, remained there till
the Thursday following, on which day four of them,
viz., Sir Everard Digby, Robert Winter, John Grant,
and Thomas Bates, were drawn upon sledges and hurdles
to a scaffold erected at the western end of St.
Paul’s churchyard. Great pains were taken in the city
to render the spectacle of the execution as imposing as
possible, Among other arrangements made in order to
be prepared against any popular tumult, a precept
issued from the Lord Mayor to the Alderman of each
ward in the city, requiring him to “cause one able and
sufficient person, with a halbard in his hand, to stand
at the door of every several dwelling-house in the open
street in the way that the traitors were to be drawn
towards the place of execution; there to remain from
seven in the morning until the return of the Sheriff.”</p>

<p>Now these four above-named being drawn to the
scaffold, made on purpose for their execution, first went
up Digby, a man of goodly personage, and a manly
aspect; yet might a wary eye, in the change of his
countenance, behold an inward fear of death, for his
colour grew pale and his eye heavy; notwithstanding
that he enforced himself to speak, as stoutly as he could.
His speech was not long, and to little good purpose,
only, that his belied conscience being but indeed a
blinded conceit, had led him into this offence, which in
respect of his religion, alias indeed idolatry, he held no
offence, but, in respect of the law, he held an offence,
for which he asked forgiveness of God, of the King,
and the whole kingdom; and so, with vain and superstitious
crossing of himself, betook him to his Latin
prayers, mumbling to himself, refusing to have any
prayers of any but of the Romish Catholics: went up
the ladder, and with the help of the hangman, made an
end of his wicked days in this world.</p>

<p>After him went Winter up the scaffold, where he used
few words to any effect, without asking mercy of either
God or the King for his offences; went up the ladder,
and, making a few prayers to himself, staid not long for
his execution.</p>

<p>After him went Grant, who abominably blinded with
his horrible idolatry, though he confessed his offence to
be heinous, yet would fain have excused it by his conscience
for religion; a bloody religion, to make so
bloody a conscience; but better that his blood, and all
such as he was, should be shed by the justice of the
law, than the blood of many thousands to have
been shed by his villainy, without law or justice.
Having used a few idle words to ill effect, he was, as his
fellows before him, led to the halter; and so, after his
crossing of himself, to the last part of his tragedy.</p>

<p>Last of them came Bates, who seemed sorry for his
offence, and asked forgiveness of God and the King, and
of the whole kingdom; prayed to God for the preservation
of them all, and, as he said, only for his love to his
master, drawn to forget his duty to God, his King, and
country, and therefore was now drawn from the Tower
to St. Paul’s churchyard, and there hanged and quartered
for his treachery. Thus ended that day’s business.</p>

<p>The next day, being Friday, were drawn from the
Tower to the old palace in Westminster, over against
the Parliament House, Thomas Winter the younger
brother, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keyes, and Guido
Fawkes, the miner, justly called “the Devil of the
Vault;” for had he not been a devil incarnate, he had
never conceived so villainous a thought, nor been employed
in so damnable an action. Winter first being
brought to the scaffold made little speech, but seeming,
after a sort, as it were, sorry for his offence, and yet
crossing himself, as though those were words to put by
the devil’s stoccadadoes, having already made a wound
in his soul; of which he had not yet a full feeling, protesting
to die a true Catholic, as he said; with a very pale
and dead colour went up the ladder, and after a swing
or two with a halter, to the quartering-block was
drawn, and there quickly despatched.</p>

<p>Next him came Rookwood, who made a speech of
some longer time, confessing his offence to God in seeking
to shed blood, and asking therefore mercy of his
Divine Majesty;&mdash;his offence to the King, of whose
majesty he likewise humbly asked forgiveness, and his
offence to the whole state, of whom in general he asked
forgiveness; beseeching God to bless the King, the
Queen, and all his royal progeny, and that they might
long live to reign in peace and happiness over this kingdom.
But last of all, to spoil all the pottage with one
filthy weed, to mar this good prayer with an ill conclusion,
he prayed God to make the King a Catholic, otherwise
a Papist, which God for his mercy ever forbid;
and so beseeching the King to be good to his wife and
children, protesting to die in his idolatry, a Romish
Catholic, he went up the ladder, and, hanging till he
was almost dead, was drawn to the block, where he gave
his last gasp.</p>

<p>After him came Keyes, who like a desperate villain,
using little speech, with small or no show of repentance,
went stoutly up the ladder, where, not staying the hangman’s
turn, he turned himself off with such a leap, that
with the swing he brake the halter, but, after his fall,
was drawn to the block, and there was quickly divided
into four parts.</p>

<p>Last of all came the great devil of all, Fawkes, <i>alias</i>
Johnson, who should have put fire to the powder. His
body being weak with torture and sickness, he was
scarce able to go up the ladder, but yet, with much ado,
by the help of the hangman, went high enough to break
his neck with the fall; who made no long speech, but
after a sort, seeming to be sorry for his offence, asked a
kind of forgiveness of the King and the state for his
bloody intent; and with his crosses and idle ceremonies,
made his end upon the gallows and the block, to the
great joy of the beholders, that the land was ended of
so wicked a villainy.</p>

<h3><a name="EXECUTION_of_Sir_WALTER_RALEIGH" id="EXECUTION_of_Sir_WALTER_RALEIGH"></a>EXECUTION of Sir WALTER RALEIGH,<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Knight, at Westminster, on the 29th of October, Anno 16<sup>o</sup>, Jacobi Regis, 1618.</i></span></h3>

<p>Upon Wednesday, the 28th of October,
<i>anno dom.</i> 1618, the Lieutenant of the
Tower, according to a warrant to him
directed, brought Sir Walter Raleigh from
the Tower to the King’s Bench Bar at Westminster,
where the record of his arraignment
at Winchester was opened, and it was demanded
why execution should not be done
upon him according to law.</p>

<p>He began, in way of answer, to justify
his proceedings in the late voyage.</p>

<p>But the Lord Chief Justice told him, That
he was therein deceived, and that the opinion
of the Court was to the contrary.</p>

<p>Master Attorney General, requiring in the
King’s behalf, that execution might be done
on the prisoner, according to the aforesaid
judgment: the Sheriffs of Middlesex were
commanded for that purpose to take him
into their custody, who presently carried
him to the Gatehouse.</p>

<p>From whence, the next morning, between
the Sheriffs of Middlesex, Sir Walter Raleigh
was brought to the old Palace Yard in
Westminster, where a large scaffold was
erected for the execution.</p>

<p>Whereupon, when he came, with a chearful
countenance, he saluted the Lords,
Knights, and gentlemen there present.</p>

<p>After which, a proclamation was made for
silence, and he addressed himself to speak
in this manner.</p>

<p>I desire to be borne withal, for this is the
third day of my fever, and if I shall shew
any weakness, I beseech you to attribute it
to my malady, for this is the hour in which
it is wont to come.</p>

<p>Then pausing a while, he sat, and directed
himself towards a window, where the Lord
of Arundel, Northampton, and Doncaster,
with some other Lords and Knights, sate,
and spake as followeth:</p>

<p>I thank God, of his infinite goodness, that
he hath brought me to die in the light, and
not in darkness; (But by reason that the
place where the Lords, &amp;c., sat, was some
distance from the scaffold, that he perceived
they could not well hear him, he said) I will
strain my voice, for I would willingly have
your honours hear me.</p>

<p>But my Lord of Arundel said, nay, we
will rather come down to the scaffold, which
he and some others did.</p>

<p>Where being come, he saluted them
severally, and then began again to speak as
followeth, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>As I said, I thank God heartily, that he
hath brought me into the light to die, and
that he hath not suffer’d me to die in the
dark prison of misery and cruel sickness;
and I thank God that my fever hath not
taken me at this time, as I prayed to God it
might not.</p>

<p>Then a proclamation being made, that all
men should depart the scaffold, he prepared
himself for death: giving away his hat, his
cap, with some money, to such as he knew
that stood near him.</p>

<p>And then putting off his doublet and
gown, he desired the Headsman to shew him
the Ax; which not being suddenly granted
unto him, he said, I prithee let me see it,
dost thou think that I am afraid of it? so
it being given unto him, he felt along upon
the edge of it, and smiling, spake unto Mr.
Sheriff, saying, this is a sharp medicine, but
it is a physician that will cure all diseases.</p>

<p>Then going to and fro upon the scaffold
one very side, he intreated the company to
pray to God to give him strength.</p>

<p>Then having ended his speech, the Executioner
kneeled down and asked him
forgiveness, which laying his hand upon his
shoulder he gave him.</p>

<p>Then being asked which way he would
lay himself on the block, he made answer,
and said, so the heart be straight, it is no
matter which way the head lieth; so laying
his head on the block, his face being towards
the east, the Headsman throwing down his
own cloak, because he would not spoil the
prisoner’s gown, he giving the Headsman a
a sign when he should strike, by lifting up
his hands, the Executioner struck off his
head at two blows, his body never shrinking
nor moving; his head was shewed on each
side of the scaffold, and then put into a red
leather bag, and his wrought velvet gown
thrown over it, which was afterwards
conveyed away in a mourning coach of his
lady’s.</p>

<span class="smaller">A TRAYTOR,</span><br />
AT TYBURN,<br />
On FRIDAY, the Twentieth of June, 1684.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Sheriffs of London and Middlesex,
about nine o’clock in the morning, coming
to Newgate, and demanding their prisoner,
he was forthwith delivered to them, and put
into a sledge, and drawn to the place of
execution, attended by a numerous guard,
and as great a number of spectators, of all
degrees and qualities, as have been seen on
such occasions. Tho’ he affected an air of
courage, yet something of sullenness and
reserve appeared in his countenance.</p>

<p>He employed the time he was drawing to
Tyburn in reading <i>The Whole Duty of Man</i>,
till he came within sight of the gallows, and
then he laid it by, and with lifted up hands
and eyes, addressed himself to Heaven, till
he came beneath the tree, where he remained
about a quarter of an hour in the sledge;
before he ascended the cart that stood ready
for him, he desired the Sheriff to admit Dr.
Tenison to come to him; and having delivered
a paper to the Sheriff, the Doctor kneeled
down with the prisoner, and prayed with
him about a quarter of an hour, during all
which time the prisoner preserved a becoming
and heroick countenance, little daunted with
the terror of that fate he was in view of;
but rising from his devotions, he pulled off
his cravat and hat, which he gave to his
servant who attended him, and had followed
him by the sledge-side, when kneeling down
himself, he prayed for a short time with
fervency and devotion, begging pardon of
his God for those manifold and crying sins
he had been too often guilty of, and
concluded with a resignation of himself
to the God of heaven and earth, before
whose judgment seat he was forthwith
to appear, desiring that the whole world
would forgive him, with whom he hoped
to die in peace and charity. Having
thus ended these devotions, he again
stood up, and putting off his periwig, he had
a white cap delivered to him, which he put
on; and being soon ty’d up, the chief of
his discourse was addressed to a gentleman
who stood by him; and after a short space,
holding up his hands, he again renewed his
prayers; his visage little changing all the
the time, till the very moment the cart drew
away; the Executioner having pulled the
cap over his eyes, he continued his prayers
all the time, and even whilst he hung, as
long as life was in him, and he had the
command of his lips; after he had hung
about half an hour, and the Executioner had
divested him of his apparel, he was cut
down according to his sentence, his privy
members burnt, his head cut off, and shew’d
to the people as that of a traitor, his heart
and bowels taken out and committed to the
flames, and his body quartered into four
parts, which, with his head, was convey’d
back to Newgate, to be dispos’d of according
to his Majesty’s pleasure.</p>

<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
<span class="larger">WILLIAM NEVISON,</span><br />
THE HIGHWAYMAN, AT YORK GAOL.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>William Nevison, the great robber of the north, was
born at Pomfret in Yorkshire, 1639, and his parents
being in good circumstances, conferred upon him a
decent education. But he was badly disposed, and
commenced his depredations by stealing cash to the
amount of £10 from his own father, then, taking a
saddle and bridle, hastened to the paddock and stole his
schoolmaster’s horse, and rode with all speed towards
London. About a mile or two from the capital he cut
the throat of the poor horse, for fear of detection.
Arrived in London he changed his name and clothes,
and commenced his wild career which at length brought
him to an untimely end.</p>

<p>In all his exploits, Nevison was tender to the fair
sex, and bountiful to the poor. He was also a true
loyalist, and never levied any contributions upon the
Royalists. His life was once spared by the royal
clemency. He then returned home, and remained with
his father until the day of his death. But soon after
returned to his former courses, his name became the
terror of every traveller on the road. He levied a
quarterly tribute on all the northern drovers, and in
return not only spared them himself, but protected them
against all other thieves, and the carriers who frequented
the road willingly agreed to leave certain sums at such
places as he appointed, to prevent their being stripped
of them all.</p>

<p>After committing a robbery in London, about sunrise,
he rode his mare to York in the course of the day, and
appeared upon the bowling green of that city before
sunset. From this latter circumstance, when brought
to trial for the offence, he established an <i>alibi</i> to the
satisfaction of the jury, though he was in reality guilty.
At length his crimes became so notorious, that a reward
was offered to any that would apprehend him. This
made many waylay him, especially two brothers
named Fletcher, one of whom Nevison shot dead. But
though he escaped for a time, he was afterwards apprehended
in a public-house at Sandal-three-houses, near
Wakefield, by Captain Milton, sent to York gaol,
where on the 15th of March, 1685, he was tried, condemned,
and executed, aged forty-five.</p>

By the High Court of Admiralty, at the Old Bailey, on the 18th day of
February, 1752, and the<br />
<span class="larger">SESSIONS GAOL DELIVERY.</span></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>James Lowry was put to the bar and arraigned on an
indictment which set forth that he, James Lowry, late
commander of the merchant ship <i>Molly</i>, did, on the
24th day of December, in the 24th year of the reign of
his present Majesty, on board the said ship <i>Molly</i>, in
latitude 49 degrees, 50 minutes, cruelly and violently
assault, strike, and beat Kenith Hossick, a mariner, on
board the said ship, with a rope the thickness of one
inch and a half, over the back, loins, shoulders, head,
face, and temples; of which beatings, wounds, and
bruises he instantly died. To which indictment the
prisoner pleaded not guilty, and put himself upon his
country for his trial. To prove which several witnesses
were called. After which the prisoner was informed
that now was his time to make his defence.</p>

<p>The prisoner then said he had no witnesses as to the
fact, but that he thought the log-book would sufficiently
support what he had said in his defence, as that the
witnesses who had been produced against him had
sworn with halters about their necks, in order to screen
themselves from their wicked acts of mutiny and piracy,
well knowing that if he escaped they must be hanged.
And then called several persons to his character; who
gave him that of a quiet, humane, good-natured man.</p>

<p>The witnesses being all examined, the judge very
impartially summed up the evidence, and gave a most
excellent and learned charge to the jury, who withdrew,
and in about half an hour returned with a verdict,
finding the prisoner “Guilty,” DEATH.</p>

<h4>THE SESSIONS GAOL DELIVERY.</h4>

<p>On the 19th began the sessions of goal delivery at
the same place, and continued till Wednesday, when
the following malefactors received sentence of death:
James Hays, Richard Broughton, and James Davis, for
street robbery; John Powney, for house-breaking;
Bernard Angua, Thomas Fox, and Thomas Gale, for
forging a note of twenty-four guineas; Ann Lewis, for
forging a seaman’s power of attorney; Antonio de
Rosa, for the murder of Mr. Fargues, at Hoxton;
Joseph Gerardino, for the murder of Christopher
Alboni; Thomas Huddle, for returning from transportation;
John Andrews, for forgery; and Ann Wilson,
for the murder of Ann Ellard.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>On the 25th Capt. Lowry was executed at Execution
Dock, pursuant to his sentence in the High Court of
Admiralty, upon which occasion was the greatest concourse
of spectators that ever was known; and though
some of the meanest of the populace were ignorant
and impudent enough to insult him as he was carried
through the streets in a cart, he behaved with great
temper, composure of countenance, and with a manly
as well as Christian courage. He declared himself
innocent of any intention of murder: said that he had
just reason to punish the person for whose death he was
to suffer; and that he gave no more than five or six
stripes at the most, with the end of a rope; and that
he believed his death was occasioned by drinking excessively
of rum just before he ordered him to be tied
up. On the place from whence he was turned off, he
asked the officer in waiting, “If he had not a reprieve
for him?” and said he forgave his enemies. His body
was carried directly down the water and hung upon a
gibbet in the gallions below Woolwich, on the river
Thames.</p>

<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
<span class="larger">JOHN SWAN AND ELIZABETH JEFFRYES,</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Who were found guilty at Chelmsford Assizes for the murder of
Mr. Joseph Jeffryes, at Walthamstow, in Essex, on the
3rd of July, 1752.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>THE TRIAL.</h4>

<p>On Tuesday, March 10th, 1752, at the Assizes at
Chelmsford, a bill of indictment was found by the
Grand Jury for petit treason, against John Swan, for
the cruel and wicked murder of his late master, Mr
Joseph Jeffryes, of Walthamstow, in the county of
Essex, and against Elizabeth Jeffryes, spinster, niece of
the deceased, for being, aiding, helping, abetting, assisting,
comforting, and maintaining him, the said John
Swan, to commit the said murder.&mdash;<span class="smcap">GUILTY DEATH</span>.</p>

<h4>THE CONFESSION</h4>

<p>On Thursday, the day after her conviction, Miss
Jeffryes made a confession, That what Mathews had
swore was true, except that part of his being in the
house at the time the pistol went off: And that she had
had this murder in her thoughts for two years past, but
never had a proper opportunity of getting it executed
before, till she engaged Swan, and together with Swan,
she offered Mathews money to execute it, who agreed
to do it; that upon the night the murder was committed,
it was agreed between Swan and her, that they should
both go up to their chambers, as if they were going to
bed, and as soon as the maid had locked her door, and
was supposed to be in bed, Miss Jeffryes came out of
her own room and went to Swan’s, and said, “Holloh!
are you awake?” he answered, “Yes,” and he was not
undressed; then she went into her uncle’s room to see
if he was asleep, and took a silver tankard, a silver
cup, and some silver spoons, from off a chest of drawers
in the deceased’s room; then she and Swan went down
stairs, and Swan took out a new sack from under the
stairs, and she and Swan put the plate, and some pewter
and brass which they took off the shelves in the
kitchen, into the sack, till she said, I can do no more.
Swan and she then drank each a large dram of brandy;
then she went upstairs into her own chamber, where it
was agreed she should undress herself, and lie till a
signal was given by a knock at her door or wainscot,
that her uncle was murder’d, then she was to open her
window, and cry out, “Diaper! fire and thieves,” to
alarm the neighbourhood. She farther says, she accidentally
fell asleep as soon almost as in bed; but on a
sudden was waked by some noise in a fright, when she
laid and listen’d, and heard a violent breathing or
gasping, as if somebody was under a difficulty in
drawing their breath; then she concluded her uncle
was murder’d; and then open’d her window, and made
the agreed alarm; directly after which she came down
stairs, and Swan let her out of the street door in her
shift, when she ran to Mrs Diaper’s door, in the same
court-yard; Swan then shut the street-door, and as soon
as he heard the neighbours were coming, and thought a
sufficient alarm was made, he opened the street-door
again in his shirt, and run out as if he was just come
out of bed in a fright. She further says, that previous
to the excuting this diabolical design, they had taken
care to cut the wire of the bell on tke outside, which
went from the master’s to the maid’s room, to prevent
his calling the maid.</p>

<p>Swan says that he did not do the murder, but that
Mathews, who came in at the garden gate, which Swan
left open for that purpose, actually did, with one of the
deceased’s pistols, which was hanging up in the kitchen;
and Swan cut a bullet, which he took out of a draw in
the kitchen to make it fit the pistol. And he is
implacable against Miss Jeffryes for having made any
confession of this melancholy and wicked affair.</p>

<p>On Saturday, March 14th, they received sentence of
death; and while the judge was making a moving and
pathetic speech before the sentence, Miss Jeffryes
fainted away several times, and at last recovered
herself, pray’d for as long a time as possible to prepare
herself for a future state.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>On the 28th, Swan and Jeffryes were executed on
Epping-Forest, near the six milestone in the parish of
Walthamstow. Swan was drawn on a sledge, and Miss
Jeffryes in a cart, in the midst of the greatest concourse
of people of all ranks and conditions, in coaches, &amp;c.,
on horseback and a-foot, that ever had been seen in the
memory of man. At the place of execution Swan was
put into the same cart with Miss Jeffryes, She acknowledged
to a gentleman, one of the jury, there present,
“That her sentence was just.” But, being asked
whether Mathews was in the house at the time the
murder was committed, she said, “She believed he was
not.” She also added that she died in charity with all
the world. Swan also confessed to the same gentleman,
“That he committed the murder.” And that he
believed Mathews was not in the house at the time of
the committing the murder, but that he had been there
just before. It was observed that these criminals did
not so much as speak, touch, or look at one another,
during the whole time they were in the cart. Miss
Jeffryes fainted when the halter was tied up; and
again when placed on a chair (she being short) for the
better conveniency of drawing away the cart. Miss
Jeffrye’s body was carried away in a hearse to be
interred. Swan’s body was immediately after cut
down, and hung in chains on the same gibbet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yesterday the six following malefactors were executed at Tyburn, viz., William Wynne Ryland, for publishing a bill of exchange,
purporting to be drawn at Fort Marlborough, in the East Indies, with intent to defraud the Hon. East India Company in London&mdash;John
Lloyd, otherwise John Ferdinando Lloyd, for a robbery in the dwelling house of John Martin&mdash;James Browne, alias Oatley, for burglary&mdash;Thomas
Burgess, for robbing Thomas Tool, in the Willow Walk, Tothil Fields, of a watch and money&mdash;James Rivers, alias Davis, for
assaulting Nathaniel Thwaits, at the house of Paul Maylor, Agent, in Broad street, and stealing a bag containing thirty eight guineas&mdash;and
John Edwards, for personating William Madden, a Marine, with intent to receive his prize-money.</p>

<p>Ryland and Lloyd went each in a mourning coach, and were followed by the others in two carts. Ryland, who led the procession,
was dressed in black, and accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Villette and two more persons.</p>

<p>The gallows was fixed about fifty yards nearer the Park wall than usual. About five minutes before eleven o’clock Ryland’s coach
drew on the right of the gallows, as did Lloyd’s on the left, and between them the cart; soon after which a violent storm of thunder, lightening,
and rain came on, when the Sheriffs gave orders for a delay of the execution. When the storm had subsided, and some time had been
employed in prayer, River was lifted from one cart into the other, which backing to Lloyd’s coach, he alighted therefrom, and entered the
vehicle. After the ropes had been fixed about their necks, Ryland stepped from the coach to join his unhappy fellow-sufferers. Alter a
conversation of at least ten minutes between Ryland and Mr. Villette, Ordinary of Newgate, and the same time employed in an earnest
discourse between Lloyd and Burgess, all the Malefactors joined in singing the hymn, called “The Sinner’s Lamentation.” The cart was
then driven away, and all were nearly at the same instant motionless.</p>

<p>At the place of execution, Lloyd confessed to the Ordinary of Newgate, that he was the person who robbed Mr. Worters, near
Woodford, in company with Chesterman, alias Jones, (who was executed last week at Chelmsford) and that Thomas (who is now under
sentence of death at Chelmsford) is innocent of that robbery. Three people swore that they saw Thomas in company with Chesterman a few
minutes before and after the robbery, and one man positively swore that Thomas was one of the men who turned round to shoot at Mr. Jones,
the Surgeon, who was pursuing them. Mr. Jones, in his evidence before Sir Sampson Wright, said, that he did not belive that Thomas was
one of the highwaymen, but had no doubt about Chesterman. The Rev. Mr. Villette requested Mr. Jones to attend yesterday morning in
Newgate, to hear Lloyd’s confession: Mr. Jones did attend, and Lloyd, in the most solemn manner, assured him that he was the man who
robbed Worters, with Chesterman, and that Thomas was innocent of that robbery.</p>

<span class="larger">JOHN AUSTIN.</span></h3>

<p class="center">Convicted at the OLD BAILEY on Saturday, Nov. 1st, 1783, of a
Cruel Highway Robbery on JOHN SPICER, a Poor Man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/divider-horizontal-1.jpg" width="250" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This robbery was so peculiarly inhuman and aggravated, that the
circumstances attending it are too interesting to the public not to be
given in the detail; nor perhaps can the Old Bailey afford an
instance more odious, or more reflecting on the depravity of human
nature.</p>

<p>John Spicer, the prosecutor, of Cray, in Kent, a poor labouring
man, was coming to town on the Tuesday before, with his bundle,
where he was a total stranger, in order to get into work, and met
with the prisoner at Ilford, where they joined company, and
travelled to town together. The prisoner, during their travelling
together, sifted the prosecutor, and got out of him the nature of
his journey, and what little property he was possessed of, undertook
to get him a lodging, provide him a master, and to show him about
London. After eating, drinking, and sleeping together on the road
at different places, they arrived in town on the Thursday, when the
prisoner took Spicer to a public house in Whitechapel, and left him
there, pretending to go out after a lodging.</p>

<p>Under this specious shew of friendship, Spicer was left for three
or four hours, when a man whose name is Patrick Bowman (who
also stands indicted, but is not yet taken) came to Spicer with a
plausible apology for Austin’s leaving him so long, and desired
Spicer to go with him to Austin, who had got him a lodging.
This the credulous prosecutor assented to, and Bowman took him to
another public-house, where they joined Austin, and from thence
they all went out, as Spicer thought, towards the lodging; but when
he found himself in the middle of a field, out of the high road, by
the side of a ditch, no house near, nor anything to be seen but the
lights of some distant lamps, he observed that it was a very comical
place to look after a lodging; upon which Austin retired a little,
and Patrick Bowman drew a cutlass, with which he kept chopping
at the hands, wrists, arms, body, and head of the prosecutor, and
mangled him in a most shocking manner. Spicer resisted this
attack, and would have got the better of Bowman, if Austin had
not come up to Bowman’s assistance; for when the poor wretch,
thinking he had a firm friend in Austin, called out, “O John, won’t
you come and help me!” Austin immediately seized him by the
collar with one hand the inside of his handkerchief, and with the
other caught hold of his legs, and threw him down, when they
rifled him of the things mentioned in the indictment, Spicer crying
out, “O John, I hope you won’t be against me.”</p>

<p>This cruel attack on the prosecutor happened to be overheard by
one James Story, a servant to Mr. Wells, a gardener, who rushing
out to the poor man’s assistance, Austin and Bowman made off, and
Story ran after to apprehend them, and overtook them, but Bowman
and Austin facing about, one with a stick, the other with a cutlass,
in order to attack him, he retreated to Spicer, whom he found in a
most mangled condition, and took him to his master, from whence
he was sent to the hospital, without hopes of recovery.</p>

<p>This was confirmed by Mr. Wells, who did everything in his
power to comfort, assist, and stop the bleeding and wounds. Early
the next morning, Story saw the prisoner coming towards the spot
where this brutal scene took place, and looking about him; Story
asked him what he was looking for, to which Austin replied, for
some money that had been lost there; upon which Story, who
before had some suspicions, apprehended Austin, and secured him
in his master’s stables; he was observed by Mr. Wells to secret a
silk handkerchief and a pair of stockings in the rack, which turned
out to be the prosecutor’s property, and on Austin being shown to
Spicer, was fixed on by him. This was the evidence, except the
prisoner’s cloaths being wet with blood when apprehended, which
was proved by Story and Mr. Wells, and one Yardly, a constable,
proved that Bowman and Austin has been companions on board the
lighters together.</p>

<p>Being called on for his defence, he said, that he acted from the
impulse of fear, and that he should not have assisted in the robbery
but for the dread and threats of Bowman. The Jury without
hesitation found him guilty; and the Recorder, who tried the
prisoner, first consulting with Baron Eyre and Judge Nares, said he
thought the case of such a nature that he should immediately
pass sentence of death. Austin being asked the usual question of
what he had to say why judgment of death should not be pronounced
against him, replied, “I don’t fear death, as I am not
guilty, and shall die innocent.”</p>

<p>The Recorder then addressed the prisoner as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>John Austin, you have been tried and convicted by a just and
yet merciful jury, upon the most clear and satisfactory evidence.
So horrid a crime as you have been guilty of, in its nature so
audacious and inhuman, calls aloud for the very severe and immediate
interposition of justice. It has been the declared intention
of our merciful Sovereign, that he will never shew any compassion
to such wretches as you, who add cruelty to robbery, and whose
attacks on the property of his peaceable and honest subjects are
accompanied with acts, whereby the crime of murder may be added
to that of robbery. Everybody must applaud a resolution founded
on the strictest justice and necessity. It is peculiarly my duty to
further his royal intentions, by making my report of such criminals
as you the first opportunity after conviction; and, therefore, to
carry his Majesty’s purpose into effect, I shall report you as a fit
object of punishment with all possible speed. Your crime has been
accompanied with every speices of aggravation. Under the mask
of friendship you have robbed a poor innocent man, deluded by
your treacherous designs, and your false friendship: it is further
aggravated by the baseness and inhumanity of your deceit, which
cannot intitle you to any instance of mercy, but requires that you
may be made an example of immediate justice. On Monday, therefore,
I shall make the report of you to his Majesty. I advise you
to prepare your soul for that fate which I am now about to
pronounce against you.</p>

<p>The Recorder then pronounced the usual sentence, and the
prisoner was taken from the bar.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>Yesterday morning was executed, at Tyburn, John Austin,
convicted last Saturday of robbing John Spicer in a field adjoining
the highway at Bethnal green, and cutting and wounding him in a
cruel manner. From Newgate to Tyburn the convict behaved
with great composure. While the halter was tying, the unhappy
wretch trembled in a very extraordinary manner, his whole frame
appearing to be violently convulsed. The Ordinary having retired
from the cart, the convict addressed himself to the surrounding
populace in the following words, “Good people, I request your
prayers for the salvation of my departing soul; let my example
teach you to shun the bad ways I have followed; keep good
company, and mind the word of God.” The cap being drawn over
his face, he raised his hands, and cried, “Lord have mercy on me,
Jesus look down with pity on me, Christ have mercy on my poor
soul;” and while uttering these exclamations, the cart was driven
away. The noose of the halter having slipped to the back part of
his neck, it was full ten minutes before he was dead.</p>

<h4>JOHN LINGARD,
PILLORY’D FOR PERJURY.</h4>

<p>On the 18th. A few minutes after twelve
at noon, Lingard, found guilty of perjury in
swearing Mr. Coleman’s life away, was
brought from the New Goal to the pillory,
near St. George’s church, Southwark, were
the executioner was several minutes before
he could get his head fix’d; as soon as he
had done his business and left the scaffold,
the people, who universally expressed their
detestation and abhorrence of the criminal,
began their attack upon him in a very
furious manner, by throwing at him mud,
stones, and sticks, so that it was imagined
he would not get off alive; however, the
mob, which was very great, moderated their
rage, and though the pelting never entirely
ceased, it, at last, considerably abated: he
got his head twice out of the hole, but it
was soon fixed again by some who used him
but roughly. He waved his hands in a suppliant
manner, begging for mercy, and
though he had a tin scull plate under his
cap, he was cut in the left side of his head,
and the blood ran down his face, He was
taken down in a dirty condition, about a
quarter before one, and had not been kept
in the pillory above half an hour. This perjured
villain formerly kept a public house
near Newington, in Surry; was a marshall’s
court officer, and frequently employed as
crier of the court.</p>

JANUARY 13th, 1786.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>THE TRIAL.</h4>

<p>In the course of the trial on Friday, the 13th, of
Hogan, the mulatto, for the murder of the servant
maid of Mr Orrell, of Charlotte street, Portland place,
the following circumstances appeared:&mdash;That as soon as
Mr. and Mrs. Orrell got into their house, the latter
found her servant reclining against the wall of the
kitchen, besmeared with blood; and on screaming out,
Mr. Orrell ran into the kitchen, and seeing the girl in this
situation, said, “Nanny! for God’s sake what have you
been doing?”&mdash;She however being unable to make any
answer, Mr. Orrell alarmed his next door neighbour,
and a surgeon was sent for, who however pronounced
her too much wounded to recover: she was however
sent to an hospital, where she expired. Her head-dress
had been entirely torn off, and thrown on the
ground, which was covered with blood, as were her
handkerchief, gown, &amp;c. Her skull was fractured
violently; her left eye was beaten almost out of its
socket; her cheekbones were both broken; her chin
was cut; her neck and throat both cut; several wounds
on her breast, particularly a large circular one; her left
arm broke, and her right arm and wrist both cut. The
instrument with which the wounds had been made was
a razor; and notwithstanding it had been thrown into a
fire, the spots of blood were not erased. It appeared
in the course of the evidence, that on the prisoner
(after very strong suspicions had been formed of his
guilt) being taken to the body of the deceased, he appeared
not in the least agitated, but putting his hand on
her breast, said, “My dear Nanny, I do remember you
very well: I never did you harm in my life?” These
expressions very forcibly added to the suspicions of his
guilt, because her face was so exceedingly cut and mangled,
that Mr. Orrell declared he himself could not possibly
have known her. Two other circumstances which
tended to criminate him were a spot of blood on a
waistcoat which he wore, and some slight marks of
blood on one of the sleeves of his coat; which coat had
been washed, though the blood on the sleeve remained;
and an effort seemed to have been made, but in vain, to
rub out the spot of blood from the waistcoat. The
principal evidence against him was the woman with
whom he cohabited, who deposed that he brought her
home a cloak, which he said he had bought on condition
of paying for at the rate of so much a week. The cloak
was produced in Court, and Mrs Orrell swore to it as
her property. The deponent further said, that after
Hogan had been twice taken before a magistrate, and
discharged for want of sufficient evidence, he at intervals
appeared to me very uneasy; that, particularly, he
could not sleep in his bed; that she finding him thus
restless, said to him one night, “For God’s sake what
is the matter with you? Surely you are not guilty of
what you have been taken up for?” That his answer
was, “Yes, I am!&mdash;I am guilty!&mdash;I did it!”&mdash;She then
was much troubled in mind, and apprehended fatal consequences
to herself from having been connected with
him; particularly as he said to her, “You must say
nothing:&mdash;you must be quiet; for if I be hanged, you
will be hanged with me.”</p>

<p>The circumstances which afterwards providently contributed,
in conjunction with the above, to lead to the
discovery of the horrid deed, are well known to the
public. It is only necessary to observe that on the last
mentioned evidence asking him why he had murdered
the young woman, he answered, “Because he wanted
to be great with her, and she resisted him.”</p>

<p>The razor with which the murder was committed
was produced in Court, and the heart of every spectator
shuddered at itc appearance.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>On Monday morning Hogan was executed on a gibbet
erected opposite Mr. Orrell’s house. A great concourse
of people attended the execution; but it has been
seldom seen that a malefactor has died so little pitied as
Hogan. Before being turned off, the prisoner bowed
four times to the populace, and in an audible voice,
confessed himself guilty of the murder, for which he
was to suffer.</p>

<h4>THE TRIAL.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Old Bailey, February 24th, 1786.</i></p>

<p>Joseph Richards was arraigned for the wilful murder
of Walter Horseman, milkman, in Kentish Town. The
deceased’s widow deposed, that the prisoner was formerly
a servant to her husband; that he was discharged for
negligence; that he had frequently threatened vengeance
on the deceased; that on the morning the murder was
committed, she was awakened by a noise, and on
entering the room her husband slept in, she found him
sitting up in the bed, and as far as his waist in blood;
that a stick which the prisoner had cut some time before,
lay in the room, and an iron bar, covered with blood;
that her husband was mangled in a shocking manner:&mdash;he
lingered a few days, and died a shocking spectacle.</p>

<p>Four other witnesses were examined, whose testimony
proved certain corroborating circumstances; such as,
being from his lodging the night the murder was committed,
being seen to melt lead, and to pour it into the
stick that was found in the deceased’s room, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The prisoner confessed the murder to one of the
magistrates who committed him for trial; but pleaded
Not Guilty at the bar.</p>

<p>The jury, after a few minutes’ consideration, brought
in their verdict Guilty.</p>

<p>Mr. Recorder pronounced judgment. He said the
voice of innocent blood cried to heaven for vengeance.
He dwelt upon the atrociousness of the crime of murder,
observing, that the Divine Law had ordained, that
whoever sheddeth man’s blood, &amp;c., and then expatiated
on the peculiar circumstances of the murder, the murder
of an innocent master, to whom he owed duty and
reverence.</p>

<p>The sentence was then passed as usual, that he be
hanged till dead, and anatomized; and an order of
Court was made out, to execute him on Monday, at
Kentish Town, as near as possible to the house of the
deceased.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>Joseph Richards, a youth about eighteen, who was
convicted on Friday last, for the wilful murder of
Walter Horseman, with whom he lived servant, was
executed at Kentish Town, opposite the house where
the horrid fact was perpetrated. The malefactor came
out of Newgate about twenty minutes before eight
o’clock, and with some alertness stepped into the cart,
which conveyed him through Smithfield, Cow Cross,
and by the two small-pox hospitals to the spot, where
he was removed from that society of which he had
proved himself a most unworthy member, at a time of
life when such atrocity of guilt as he possessed has
been seldom known to degrade humanity. In his way
to the place of execution, the convict appeared to be in
a state of mind bordering upon stupefaction; he had no
book, nor did he employ the short remnant of time in
those preparations for eternity which his miserable
situation rendered so indispensably necessray.</p>

<p>Before being turned off, the prisoner desired to see
the widow of the deceased; she was sent for to her
house, but was gone to London; he declared he had no
accomplice in the fact, and that he was induced to the
perpetration thereof by the supposition, that after the
decease of his master he should succeed to his business
as a milkman. Just before coming to the village, he
burst into tears, and when he came to the place of
execution, wept bitterly; his expressions of sorrow and
contrition being only interrupted by fervent appeals
to Heaven for mercy till the last moment of his
existence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following male convicts, viz., Edward Griffiths,
George Woodward, William Watts, Daniel Keefe,
Jonathan Harwood, and William Smith, were executed
pursuant to their sentence, on the scaffold usually
erected opposite Newgate. They were brought out at
half-past seven in the morning, and the platform
dropped about eight o’clock. Woodward was so exceedingly
weak, that he was obliged to sit down till the
executioneer had tied up the rest, and was then supported
by two men.</p>

<h4>The Barbarious Execution and Burning
of Phœbe Harris.</h4>

<p>Soon after the above execution, Phœbe Harris, convicted
the session before last of coining silver, was
brought out at the debtor’s door, from whence she
walked to a stake fixed in the ground, about half way
between the scaffold and Newgate street. She was
immediately tied by the neck to an iron bolt fixed near
the top of the stake, and after praying very fervently
for a few minutes, the steps on which she stood were
drawn away, and she immediately became suspended.
The executioner, with some assistants, put a chain round
her body, which was fastened by strong nails to the
stake. Two cart-loads of faggots were then piled round
her, and after she had hung about half an hour, the fire
was kindled. The flames presently burning the halter,
the convict fell a few inches, and was then suspended by
the iron chain passed over her chest and affixed to the
stakes. Some scattered remains of the body were perceptible
in the fire at half-past ten o’clock. The fire
had not quite burnt out even at twelve. The unhappy
woman was so exceedingly affected on Monday night,
that it was generally supposed (and indeed wished)
that she could not have survived.</p>

<p>Phœbe Harris was a well made little woman, something
more than thirty years of age, of a pale complexion,
and not of disagreeable features. When she
came out of prison she appeared languid and terrified,
and trembled greatly as she advanced to the stake,
where the apparatus for the punishment she was about
to experience seemed to strike her mind with horror and
consternation, to the exclusion of all power of recollectedness
in preparation for the approaching awful
moment. A great concourse of people attended on the
melancholy occasion.</p>

<p class="right">April 24, 1787.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning the following convicts were
executed on the newly-invented temporary scaffold,
placed before the debtors’ door of Newgate:&mdash;John
Burn, Daniel Gunter, James Francis, and John Green,
convicted in January sessions; and William Ludlam,
William Oakes, John Bishop, alias John Buller, and
James Haylock, alias Hullock, formerly a runner at a
public office, convicted in February sessions.&mdash;After
divine service in the chapel of Newgate, the prisoners
were brought out of the gaol, and six of them having
joined the ordinary in devout prayer, and chaunted the
usual psalm (the others, being two Roman Catholicks,
were attended by a priest of that persuasion). At nine
o’clock the platform dropped, and in a few moments
they showed no signs of life. They were fervent in
their devotions, and all of them appeared to die sincerely
penitent.</p>

<p>The scaffold on which these miserable people suffered
is a temporary machine, which was drawn out of the
yard of the sessions-house by horses; it had this day
only one beam fixed; and upon a bolt being drawn, the
platform dropped, leaving the malefactors suspended in
a manner similar to that of the scaffold lately in use.</p>

<p>After the convicts were cut down, the gallows was
drawn back to the sessions-house yard; and the whole
cleared away in half-an-hour’s time.</p>

<p class="center"><i>An Account of the new-invented Scaffold for Executing
Criminals in the Old Bailey.</i></p>

<p>We imagine that an accurate representation of the
new mode of executing criminals in the Old Bailey,
which does so much honour to the present worthy
Sheriffs, will hardly fail of giving satisfaction to such,
at least, as do not reside near the metropolis.</p>

<p>The whole of this temporary erection is hung in
black. The criminals are attended by the proper
officers and the Ordinary of Newgate, from their cells
to the centre part of the scaffold, which is a platform
raised about two or three inches above the general floor,
and directly under the gallows: here, after the usual
prayers and solemnities, the rope is tied up, and, at the
Sheriff’s signal, the executioner pulls away a staple,
which loosens a bar that supports the platform, and the
platform then falls in: and this, being much more
sudden and regular than that of a cart being drawn
away, has the effect of immediate death. During the
whole time of this awful spectacle, a full-toned bell,
which is suspended above the roof of this part of the
prison, is solemnly tolled; but as it is fixed so far on
the roof as not to be in sight, it does not appear. The
scaffold is supported by strong posts, fixed into grooves
made in the street, and the whole is temporary, being
all calculated to take to pieces, which are preserved
within the prison.</p>

about to suffer. The Rev. Dr. Hatherall, chaplain of
the <i>Sandwich</i>, administered the sacrament to all of

<h4>THE TRIAL.</h4>

<p>At the Old Bailey, Martin Clinch and Samuel Mackley
were capitally convicted of the wilful murder of Mr
Fryer, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. It appears
by the evidence, that the deceased and his cousin, Miss
Fryer, were walking across the fields in their way
from Southampton Buildings, Holborn, towards Islington:
that, when they arrived at the field called the
cricket field, near White Conduit house, they heard a
noise, as of some person in distress; this induced the
deceased to go to the spot. At this time, Miss Fryer,
the principal witness on this occasion, was at some distance
from him. By the time she came to the stile,
which she had crossed in his way to the place, she saw
Clinch fire, when the deceased fell into a small pond.
Clinch then took his watch out of his fob, and a sum of
money out of his pocket. By this time Miss Fryer had
got on the other side of the stile, when the prisoner,
Mackley, held a pistol to her head, and took her cloak
from her. They then went away, and Mr. Fryer was
taken to a house at a short distance from the spot,
where he died at eleven o’clock the same evening. The
evidence in support of the above statement, as given by
Miss Fryer, was clear, artless, and unembarassed.
When asked if she really believed Clinch to be the man
who shot Mr Fryer, she said she believed from her soul
he was; with regard to Mackley, she seemed not quite
so positive; several witnesses, however, proved his being
seen in the same field within a few minutes of the time
the murder happened, who all had noticed him, on
account of his having red hair. The prisoners being
called on for their defence, they only said they were
innocent, but could give no account where they were at
the time the murder was committed. The jury went
out for about half an hour, and returned with a verdict&mdash;Guilty.</p>

<p>The sessions being ended, the same were adjourned
until Wednesday, July 12, 1797.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>Yesterday morning were executed at the front of
Newgate, Martin Clinch and Samuel Mackley, for the
daring robbery and cruel murder of Mr Fryer, in Islington
fields. An extremely disagreeable circumstance
occurred shortly before the period which is usually
allowed to men in their unfortunate situation. The
floor of the scaffold, from some previous misarrangement,
gave way, and precipitated into the area of the
apparatus, Messrs Vilette and Gaffy, the latter a
Catholic priest, who attended Clinch, and the two
executioners; Mr. Sheriff Stains had himself a very
narrow escape. Mr. Gaffy being a lusty man was
severely hurt, as were both the executioners; Mr
Vilette escaped with a slight bruise. The two unfortunate
malefactors swung off with their distorted
features exposed to the view of the distressed spectators.
By the laudable activity of Mr. Ramsden, the prison
surgeon, however, the cap was drawn over their faces
afterwards. Their bodies were removed to a proper
place for the purposes of dissection and exposure.
They both denied to the last moment having had any
concern in the murder.</p>

<h3><a name="AN_ACCOUNT_OF_THE" id="AN_ACCOUNT_OF_THE"></a>AN ACCOUNT OF THE<br />
COURT MARTIAL, SENTENCE, AND EXECUTION<br />
<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
<span class="larger">RICHARD PARKER FOR MUTINY,</span></h3>

<p class="center">Held on board His Majesty’s ship the NEPTUNE, lying in
the river Thames, off Greenhithe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Court was formed on Thursday, June 22, 1797, and the
prisoner was charged with making, and having endeavoured to
make, a mutiny among the seamen of His Majesty’s ships at the
Nore; with having caused assemblies of these seamen to meet
frequently, and with having behaved himself contemptuously
toward and disobeyed his officers.</p>

<p>Captain Moss, of the Sandwich, was the prosecutor, and after
the whole of the evidence had been gone through, the prisoner was
ordered to withdraw, and the court was cleared for the purpose of
leaving the members to deliberate on the sentence.</p>

<p>In two hours and a half the Court was re-opened, and the
prisoner being called in, the sentence of the Court was read by the
Judge Advocate to the following purport:&mdash;“That Richard Parker
do suffer death, and to be hanged by the neck on board of one of
His Majesty’s ships, and at such time as the Lords of the Admiralty
may think proper.”</p>

<p>On Friday, June 30, at eight o’clock in the morning, a gun was
fired from on board His Majesty’s ship L’Espion, lying off Sheerness
garrison, Vice-Admiral Lutwidge’s flag ship, and the yellow flag,
the signal of capital punishment, was hoisted, which was immediately
repeated by the Sandwich hoisting the same colour on her
fore-top. At half-past eight Parker was told the chaplain was
ready to attend him. He now requested a minute to collect himself,
and knelt down in prayer, then, rising up, said, “I am ready,”
and holding his head up, said to the boatswain’s mate, “take off
my handkerchief,” which being done, the Provost-Marshal placed
the halter over his head (which had been prepared with grease),
but doing it awkwardly, the prisoner said rather pettishly to the
boatswain’s mate, “Do you do it, for he seems to know nothing
about it!” The halter was then spliced to the reeved rope; all
this being adjusted, the Marshal attempted to put a cap on,
which he refused; but on being told it was indispensible, he submitted,
requesting it might not be pulled over his eyes till he desired
it. He then turned round for the first time, and gave a steady look
at his shipmates on the forecastle, and, with an affectionate kind of
a smile, nodded his head, and said, “Good-bye to you!” He now
said, “Captain Moss, is the gun primed?” “It is.” “Is the
match alight” “All is ready.” He now ascended the platform,
repeated the same questions about the gun, then the cap being
drawn over his face, walking by firm degrees up to the extremity of
the scaffold, he dropped the handkerchief, put his hands in his coat
pocket with great rapidity, and at the moment as he was springing
off, the fatal bow-gun fired, and the reeve rope catching him, run
him up, though not with great velocity, to the yard arm. When
suspended about midway, his body appeared extremely convulsed
for a few seconds, immediately after which no appearance of life
remained. He suffered exactly at half-past nine, and was lowered
down, after hanging at the yard-arm a full hour, when the yellow
flag was struck, and his body instantly put into a shell that had been
prepared for it, with all his clothes on; and soon after it was taken
in one of the Sandwich’s boats and rowed to the east point of the
garrison, and there being landed was carried to the new naval burying
ground, out of the Red Barrier Gate, leading to Minster; the
coffin lid was here taken off to the spectators for a few minutes;
his countenance appeared not much altered, but his eyes were wide
open. He was interred exactly at noon. His body was afterward
secretly taken up, and conveyed to London, and decently interred in
Whitechapel church yard.</p>

<h3 class="hanging"><a name="MARY_NOTT" id="MARY_NOTT"></a>Trial and Execution of Mary Nott, for the dreadful Murder of
a French emigrant; and the Trial and Execution of Richard
Ludman and Eleanor Hughes, for the Murder of George
Hebner in a Brothel.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mary Nott was tried at the Old Bailey, for the
wilful murder of the Count de Greffiere de Laval, a
French emigrant. It appeared in evidence, that she
had the care of a house, which was let out in lodgings,
in Monmouth court, Whitcomb street, the front room
on the first floor of which was occupied by the count.
The lodger in the room adjoining, not hearing the count
as usual, had, for several mornings, enquired after him;
when the prisoner said she supposed he was gone into
the country with a French man and woman who used
to call on him, but had not been there since his absence,
for she had not seen him; that the key was not in his
door, and, upon looking through the keyhole, she
observed the room was just as she left it.&mdash;To another
witness, who had called to see the count, she said that
he had gone out very early that morning, and that she
did not expect him home until it was late. Some
doubts, however, arising from his absence, a ladder was
procured, perfectly with the consent of the prisoner,
to look into the room of the deceased; and upon the
person’s calling out that there was a man upon the bed,
she cried out, that she would not have remained there
last night if she had known there was a man dead in
the house; and upon which she, in fact, alarmed the
neighbourhood. A smith was sent for, and the door
forced open: the deceased was found lying on the bed
with all his clothes on but his coat; he was wrapped up
in the bedclothes, and pillows covered his head: there
was a great deal of blood in the room, a wound was
observed in the neck, and the body was nearly in a state
of putrefaction. A woman, who lived in an opposite
house, and who had observed the prisoner shut one of
the windows, which prevented her seeing into the
prisoner’s room, on the day the murder was supposed to
have been committed, went up with her at the time the
door was opened, and observing his right hand pocket
was turned out, said, “He has been robbed;” to which
the prisoner instantly replied, “He did it himself;”
upon this witness made a similar remark that he must
have been murdered, she again said, “He did it
himself;” and upon her noticing a wash-hand basin
with some water in it tinged with blood, as if some
person had wrinsed their hands therein, the prisoner
said, “It is not strange, not strange at all; what do
you come here to raise suspicion for?” Another neighbour
had heard a scream about two o’clock on that day,
but could not say whence it came. The deceased was
seen coming toward home between twelve and one
o’clock, and as the lodger in the next room went home
as early as five, the supposition was that the murder
had been committed in that time. The surgeon who
examined the body swore positively there was no wound
in the side of the deceased, but that the raised skin,
supposed to be such, was from the putrefaction; nor
would he undertake to say what was the cause of his
death, although a considerable quantity of blood might
have issued from the wound in his neck.&mdash;Beside this
testimony, which included all that related to the
prisoner, it appeared that the deceased’s portmanteau
had been cut; that there was a knife upon the table,
which was by no means bloody; that in his left-hand
pocket he had a knife and a key, the latter of which
opened a drawer, wherein were several pieces of French
coin and three guineas; that the deceased had been
possessed of a very considerable property in France,
and upon emigrating to this country, an agent in the
city had allowed him twenty pounds per month: but
affairs taking such a turn there, that pittance had been
stopped, and he was so reduced, that a friend had
forced upon him the loan of four guineas; he having
no other clothes than those on his back. The prisoner
denied the charge generally, and called three persons to
her character, one of whom said she was of so humane
a disposition, that if a worm lay in her way, she would
turn aside rather than do it an injury. The jury
returned a verdict of guilty. She is aged 63.&mdash;Richard
Ludman, Ann Rhodes, Eleanor Hughes, and Mary
Baker, were likewise indicted for the murder of George
Hebner. This murder was committed in King street,
East Smithfield, in one of those obscure receptacles of
debauchery with which this metropolis abounds. The
body of the deceased was found on the morning of
Sunday, the 22nd of May, suspended by the neck from
a bed-post, in a room on the second floor, with his
hands tied behind his back. It was proved that the
four prisoners were in the house (which belonged to
Eleanor Hughes) on the evening of Saturday, the 21st,
and next morning. They were seen, and some of their
conversations heard, by two women who lived in an
adjoining house; this house was separated from that in
which the deceased was found by only a lath partition,
perforated in several places, and the holes and crevices
affording a distinct view of almost all the apartments
of the latter.&mdash;The manner in which the hands of the
deceased were bound with a piece of tape was described
in the court. The knot that had been used was what
seamen call a timber hitch, and it was obviously such
could not have been done by himself. There was no
direct and positive proof of the guilt of the prisoners;
but there was a chain of most suspicious circumstances
pointing strongly against Ludman and Hughes. The
lord chief baron summed up the evidence with great
precision, candour, and humanity. It was on the
expressions used by the prisoners that the proof chiefly
rested, and his lordship nicely discriminated between
those which seemed to arise from surprise, on the
discovery of the situation of the deceased, and those
which could be supposed to proceed only from a knowledge
of the murder. The jury returned a verdict,
finding Richard Ludman and Eleanor Hughes guilty.
Ann Rhodes and Mary Baker not guilty.&mdash;Eleanor
Hughes pleaded pregnancy, to stay the execution of her
sentence. On which a jury of matrons was collected
and sworn, to examine her, and report their opinion to
the court. They retired with the prisoner about half-an-hour,
and at their return declared her to be “with
child, but not quick with child.”</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>Yesterday, Mary Nott, convicted of the murder of
Le Comte de Laval, an emigrant nobleman; and also
Richard Ludman and Eleanor Hughes, convicted of the
murder of George Hebner, were executed on a temporary
platform in the Old Bailey, before the gaol of
Newgate, pursuant to their sentence; after which the
bodies were delivered at Surgeons’-hall for dissection.</p>

<span class="smaller">FOR THE</span><br />
<span class="larger">HORRIBLE MURDER</span><br />
<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
MR. PARKER &amp; HIS HOUSEKEEPER.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This wretched criminal surrendered his life to-day to the outraged
laws of his country, From the complication of crimes of which
he was convicted, and from the probability that the murder of
Mr. Parker and his housekeeper was not the first instance in which
he had been guilty of a violation of the laws, great curiosity prevailed
to witness his execution, in the expectation that, if he had
not previously made any confession he would in his last moments be
induced to reveal the particulars of his guilt.</p>

<p>After his family had taken leave of him, he made a full confession
of his guilt. Some of the particulars which he communicated
are said to be very important, and the whole of his
statement is, for the present, kept strictly secret. Various rumours
are, of course, in circulation respecting the nature of his confession
to which it would be equally improper to give publicity, whether
they be ill or well founded.</p>

<p>After his mind had been disburdened of the load of guilt which
had pressed so heavily on it, he became more composed, and joined
in the exercises of devotion with more fixed attention, and apparently
with a greater degree of intelligence, than he had hitherto
evinced. On Sunday night he slept for more than two hours;
and this morning he was more tranquil than usual. The Rev. Mr
Harker, whose humane exertions in administering to him the
consolations of religion, have all along been unremitted, attended
him at 6 o’clock, and remained with him till eight. He returned
again at nine o’clock, to assist him in preparing for the last awful
trial of his fortitude.</p>

<p>At a quarter past eleven the unhappy culprit was placed in a
waggon, to be drawn to the place of execution, on Pennenden
heath, about a mile from Maidstone gaol. The executioner was
placed by his side, and two officers with loaded carbines were also
seated in the waggon, fronting the criminal. His dress was the
same that he had worn during his trial, consisting of a blue coat,
a yellow waistcoat, a white neck cloth, and top boots. The
procession moved slowly towards the heath, the criminal frequently
turned up his eyes to heaven, and ejaculating “O Lord, have
mercy upon me! Christ, have mercy upon me!”&mdash;About 100 yards
from the prison gate his mother caught his eye in the crowd. He
did not appear to be much moved at seeing her, but bent his head
to one of the officers who sat before him, and said, “Mind, tell Mr
Bowen to do something for my family.” The procession arrived
at the place of execution about 10 minutes before 12, and the
waggon was drawn up along the side of the scaffold. The chaplain
then joined the criminal in prayer, and the stillest silence
pervaded the immense crowd, who stood uncovered while the
service was reading. The criminal, who had knelt down by Mr
Harker’s side, joined in the prayers with as much fervour as his
agitation would permit. His hands were clasped together and
uplifted, and his eyes were sometimes directed downwards to the
book in the chaplain’s hand, as if he did not understand what was
read; occasionally they were turned up to heaven, but during the
greater part of the time they wandered unconsciously over the
crowd without any definite direction.</p>

<p>When the devotions were closed, and the criminal was about to
be removed from the waggon, he observed near him Mr Hay, the
barrack master of Woolwich, and said he wished to speak to him.
Mr Hay come forward and said, “For God’s sake, Nisbett, be
sincere; consider what you are about, and tell the truth.” He
replied, “I have told the truth already, and nothing but the
truth. My family knows nothing of my guilt, and I hope you
will do something for them.” Mr Hay asked him if he had
confessed his guilt; and he replied, “I have confessed it to
another person.” He then mounted the stage with a firm step,
and the executioner proceeded to put a cap over his eyes, and to
adjust the rope round his neck. Having seen Mr Bowen, of
Woolwich, near the scaffold, he called to him and said, “Mr Bowen,
I hope you will have some regard for my family. Poor things!
they are innocent. None that belongs to me know anything of my
doings.” Mr Bowen called to him to confess his crime, on which
he replied, “I have made all the confession I had to make.
That will be known after I am gone. The people is convenient
that has it. It is enough for one person to know.”</p>

<p>At 5 minutes after 12 o’clock the fatal signal was given. He
did not seem to suffer more than one minute. The body, after
hanging the usual time, was cut down, and conveyed in a shell to
Messrs. Day and Watman’s to be anatomized, pursuant to his sentence.</p>

<p>Previously to his trial, Nesbett had prepared the following
declaration, in his own hand-writing, to be delivered to Mr Hay,
the barrack master of Woolwich, an intelligent and humane
gentleman, who was anxious to have it ascertained that the family
of the murderer were not implicated in his guilt:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Maidstone, the 24th July, 1820</p>

<p>“This is the truth, as I have God to meit it in the next world,

or Not of the Crime that is laid to my Charge, that is the murder
of Mr Parker and his House-keeper, or any other part of that
Crime that is laid to my Charge, or any other crime that is laid to
me, As God has my soul in his Charge this Day to try my Guilt
that is the truth, and I hope no one will Cast it up to my wife or

<div class="verse indent2">Thus unto her did say:</div>
<div class="verse">Nancy, my charming creature,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">You have my heart ensnared,</div>
<div class="verse">My love is such I am resolved</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To wed you I declare.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus by his false deluding tongue</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Poor Nancy was beguil’d,</div>
<div class="verse">And soon to her misfortune,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">By him she proved with child.</div>
<div class="verse">Some days ago this damsel fair</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Did write to him with speed,</div>
<div class="verse">Such tenderness she did express</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Would make a heart to bleed.</div>
<div class="verse">She said, my dearest William,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I am with child by thee;</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore, my dear, pray let me know</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When you will marry me.</div>

<div class="verse indent2">This young man did repair,</div>
<div class="verse">Unto the town of Wirksworth,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To meet his Nancy there.</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, Nancy dear, come let us walk,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Among the flowery fields,</div>
<div class="verse">And then the secrets of my heart</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To you I will reveal.</div>
<div class="verse">O then this wicked young man</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A knife he did provide,</div>
<div class="verse">And all unknown to his true love</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Concealed it by his side.</div>
<div class="verse">When to the fatal spot they came,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">These words to her did say:</div>
<div class="verse">All on this very night I will</div>

<div class="verse">On bended knees she then did fall,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In sorrow and despair,</div>
<div class="verse">Aloud for mercy she did call,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Her cries did rend the air;</div>
<div class="verse">With clasped hands and uplift eyes</div>
<div class="verse indent2">She cried, Oh spare my life,</div>
<div class="verse">I never more will ask you</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To make me your wedded wife.</div>
<div class="verse">O then this wicked young man said,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">No mercy will I show;</div>
<div class="verse">He took the knife all from his side,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And pierced her body through.</div>
<div class="verse">But still she smiling said to him,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">While trembling with fear,</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! William, William, spare my life;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Think on your baby dear.</div>
<div class="verse">Twice more then with the bloody knife</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He ran her body through,</div>
<div class="verse">Her throat was cut from ear to ear,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Most dreadful for to view;</div>
<div class="verse">Her hands and arms and beauteous face</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He cut and mangled sore,</div>
<div class="verse">While down upon her milk white breast</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The crimson blood did pour.</div>
<div class="verse">He took the shawl from off her neck,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And round her body tied,</div>
<div class="verse">With pebble stones he did it fill,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thinking the crime to hide.</div>
<div class="verse">O then into the silver stream</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He plunged her straightway,</div>
<div class="verse">But with her precious blood was stained,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Which soon did him betray.</div>
<div class="verse">O then this young man taken was,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And into prison sent,</div>
<div class="verse">In ratling chains he is confin’d,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">His crime for to lament,</div>
<div class="verse">Until the Assizes do come on</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When trembling he must stand,</div>
<div class="verse">Reflecting on the deed he’s done;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Waiting the dread command.</div>
<div class="verse">Now all you thoughtless young men</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A timely warning take;</div>

<span class="largest">JOHN THURTELL</span><br />
<span class="wordpicture">AT HERTFORD GAOL,</span>
<img class="wordpicture" src="images/at-hertford-gaol.jpg" width="495" height="40" alt="AT HERTFORD GAOL," /><br />
On Friday, the 9th of January, 1824.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p class="right"><i>Hertford, half-past twelve o’clock.</i></p>

<p>This morning, at ten minutes before twelve, a bustle
among the javelin-men stationed within the boarded
enclosure on which the drop was erected, announced to
the multitude without that the preparations for the
execution were nearly concluded. The javelin-men
proceeded to arrange themselves in the order usually
observed upon these melancholy but necessary occurrences.
They had scarcely finished their arrangements,
when the opening of the gate of the prison gave an
additional impulse to public anxiety.</p>

<p>When the clock was on the stroke of twelve, Mr
Nicholson, the Under-Sheriff, and the executioner
ascended the platform, followed on to it by Thurtell,
who mounted the stairs with a slow but steady step.
The principal turnkey of the gaol came next, and was
followed by Mr Wilson and two officers. On the
approach of the prisoner being intimated by those
persons who, being in an elevated situation, obtained the
first view of him, all the immense multitude present
took off their hats.</p>

<p>Thurtell immediately placed himself under the fatal
beam, and at that moment the chimes of a neighbouring
clock began to strike twelve. The executioner then
came forward with the rope, which he threw across it.
Thurtell first lifted his eyes up to the drop, gazed at it
for a few moments, and then took a calm but hurried
survey of the multitude around him. He next fixed
his eyes on a young gentleman in the crowd, whom he
had frequently seen as a spectator at the commencement
of the proceedings against him. Seeing that the
individual was affected by the circumstance, he removed
them to another quarter, and in so doing recognised an
individual well known in the sporting circles, to whom
he made a slight bow.</p>

<p>The prisoner was attired in a dark brown great coat,
with a black velvet collar, white corduroy breeches,
drab gaiters and shoes. His hands were confined with
handcuffs, instead of being tied with cord, as is usually
the case on such occasions, and, at his own request, his
arms were not pinioned. He wore a pair of black kid
gloves, and the wrists of his shirt were visible below
the cuffs of his coat. As on the last day of his trial,
he wore a white cravat. The irons, which were very
heavy, and consisted of a succession of chain links,
were still on his legs, and were held up in the middle
by a Belcher handkerchief tied round his waist.</p>

<p>The executioner commenced his mournful duties by
taking from the unhappy prisoner his cravat and collar.
To obviate all difficulty in this stage of the proceedings,
Thurtell flung back his head and neck, and so gave the
executioner an opportunity of immediately divesting
him of that part of his dress. After tying the rope
round Thurtell’s neck, the executioner drew a white
cotton cap over his countenance, which did not, however,
conceal the contour of his face, or deprive him
entirely of the view of surrounding objects.</p>

<p>At that moment the clock sounded the last stroke of
twelve. During the whole of this appalling ceremony,
there was not the slightest symptom of emotion discernible
in his features; his demeanour was perfectly calm
and tranquil, and he behaved like a man acquainted
with the dreadful ordeal he was about to pass, but not
unprepared to meet it. Though his fortitude was thus
conspicuous, it was evident from his appearance that in
the interval between his conviction and his execution
he must have suffered much. He looked careworn; his
countenance had assumed a cadaverous hue, and there
was a haggardness and lankness about his cheeks and
mouth, which could not fail to attract the notice of
every spectator.</p>

<p>The executioner next proceeded to adjust the noose
by which Thurtell was to be attached to the scaffold.
After he had fastened it in such a manner as to satisfy
his own mind, Thurtell looked up at it, and examined
it with great attention. He then desired the executioner
to let him have fall enough. The rope at this
moment seemed as if it would only give a fall of two or
three feet. The executioner assured him that the fall
was quite sufficient. The principal turnkey then went
up to Thurtell, shook hands with him, and turned away
in tears. Mr Wilson, the governor of the gaol, next
approached him. Thurtell said to him, “Do you
think, Mr Wilson, I have got enough fall?” Mr
Wilson replied, “I think you have, Sir. Yes, quite
enough.” Mr Wilson then took hold of his hand,
shook it, and said, “Good bye, Mr Thurtell, may God
Almighty bless you.” Thurtell instantly replied,
“God bless <i>you</i>, Mr Wilson, God bless <i>you</i>.” Mr
Wilson next asked him whether he considered that the
laws of his country had been dealt to him justly and
fairly, upon which he said, “I admit that justice has
been done me&mdash;I am perfectly satisfied.”</p>

<p>A few seconds then elapsed, during which every
person seemed to be engaged in examining narrowly
Thurtell’s deportment. His features, as well as they
could be discerned, appeared to remain unmoved, and
his hands, which were extremely prominent, continued
perfectly steady, and were not affected by the slightest
tremulous motion.</p>

<p>Exactly at two minutes past twelve the Under-Sheriff,
with his wand, gave the dreadful signal&mdash;the
drop suddenly and silently fell&mdash;and</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">John Thurtell was launched
into Eternity.</span></p>

<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
<span class="larger">C. T. WHITE,</span> FOR ARSON, <span class="larger">&amp; AMELIA ROBERTS,</span> FOR A ROBBERY,<br />
AT THE OLD BAILEY.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE</span><br />
<span class="larger">Horrible &amp; Appaling Spectacle</span><br />
WITNESSED ON THE FATAL GALLOWS.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yesterday morning, before 8 o’clock, an immense assemblage of
spectators, in numbers equal to those who witnessed the fate of
Fauntleroy, crowded the Old Bailey, from one end to the other, to
witness the execution of Charles Thomas White, late a bookseller
in Holborn, for the crime of arson, and Amelia Roberts, for an
aggravated robbery. The unfortunate man White had excited an
extraordinary interest.</p>

<p>The young woman, Roberts, who was convicted of robbing Mr
Austin, of Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell, with whom she lived as
cook, of property to the amount of £400 and upwards, and Patrick
Riley, her sweetheart, was convicted of the same offence. The
conduct of this unhappy creature has been such, during her confinement,
as to excite the respect, pity, and commisseration of those
who visited her. She has been extremely attentive to her religious
duties, and the principal thing that engrossed her attention relative
to this world was to exculpate Riley, and hear that he was converted
from what she deemed Papistical errors. On the evening of
Sunday she was amazingly cheerful, and said, as her punishment
was just, she would rather undergo it than return into a world of
temptation.</p>

<p>The conduct of White was very different, the bare contemplation
of the awful moment of execution unmanned him. He totally disregarded
religious exercises, and sat day after day brooding over
his past life, and occasionally starting upon his feet, bitterly
inveighing against his sentence. Immediately after his trial, and
for a long time subsequent, the unfortunate young man persisted
in his entire innocence, and strove to convince others of it, by that
sort of sophistical reasoning of which his defence consisted. He
has asked over and over again what could have been his motive to
commit so flagrant a crime, when his circumstances were not
embarrassed, and his prospects flattering?</p>

<p>At length, however, he confessed his guilt, but in excuse pleaded
that he was of unsound mind at the time. Finding, at length,
that in all probability the door of mercy would be closed against
him, he had recourse to many ingenious measures to effect his
escape; and it appears quite clear, that he must have some powerful
auxiliaries, both among his fellow prisoners and outside of the
prison.</p>

<p>When the warrant of death arrived, which included his name,
the wretched man at first raved like a maniac, his fondly cherished
hope being cut off, but when he regained composure, his thoughts
and conversation were again engaged upon an attempt to escape.
A few days before that fixed for his execution, he said, “I know
that I am a sinner, but God is merciful, and I hope to go to
Heaven. I know, too, that I must suffer, but I never allow myself
to think of the day.”</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>White ascended the platform with an unsteady and tremulous step.
Slark, the Sheriff’s attendant, with a black wand, accompanied
him, and said something to the executioner, who called his
assistant, and they immediately conducted White to the west end
of the platform, and while one adjusted a rope through the chain
attached to the beam, the other held his hands and arms. White
trembled, and his agitation seemed to increase; he raised his
arms, and extended his chest, as if desirous of bursting the cords,
and by the effort loosened his wrists. The cap was drawn over his
eyes, but the restlessness of the unhappy man seemed to increase; and,
just as the woman was ascending the steps, he bent his head down,
and pushed off the cap, accompanying this action by a violent
movement of the body, as if to break or get his head out of the fatal
noose. The action was made with so much strength and violence,
and his struggling appearing to increase, that a dreadful yell, and
cries of the utmost horror burst from the crowd. The two assistant
executioners were called to ascend the platform, and they held the
unhappy man while a handkerchief was tied over his eyes. They
endeavoured to draw a cap over his face, but he struggled hard
with the executioner, and repeatedly forced it off. The executioner
seized the unhappy man with some violence, to induce him to
desist from proceeding to loosen his hands, and the crowd renewed
their former cries and yellings.</p>

<p>Amelia Roberts was then brought upon the scaffold, and a cord
having been tied round her lower garments, the rope was adjusted
round her neck. White again got the handkerchief off, and turning
to the woman and crowd alternately, by his gestures, appeared as if
desirous of exciting universal sympathy. The arrangements of
the executioner being complete, he removed the woman to a
position immediately under the fatal beam, and then placed White
by her side; but the unhappy man gradually moved forward, until
he gradually got his toes upon the ledge, where Mr Cotton and
Mr. Baker were reading the Burial Service. The handkerchief
was again placed over his eyes, but it was evident, from the fineness
of its texture, and what occurred soon afterwards, that he must
have seen through it. At the moment Mr Cotton drew a white
handkerchief from under his surplice, he leaped upon the platform,
and by sinking his head was able to grasp that part of the cord
which was affixed round his neck under his chin. It appeared to
be a desperate effort to prolong that life which he so fondly clung
to. At this moment the spectacle was most horrifying&mdash;he was
partly suspended, and partly standing on the platform. During the
violence of his exertions, his tongue was forced out of his mouth,
and the convulsions of his body and contortions of his face were
truly appalling. The cries of displeasure from the crowd were
again renewed, and they continued till the executioner had forced
the wretched man’s hands from the cord, and moved his feet from
the platform, when in an instant the rope had its full tension; and,
by pulling the man’s legs, he ceased struggling, and in a few
minutes was dead. It is thought, that if his arms had not been
fastened by a cord, the handkerchief would have given way, and
the most painful consequences would have resulted. As it was, his
sufferings were considerably protracted. The distortions of his
countenance, in the agonies of death, could be seen by the crowd;
and, as he remained suspended without any covering to his face, the
horrible spectacle was most terrific. The shrieks of the women,
and the cries of the men, rendered the scene more painful than any
one we had ever witnessed before; and but for the wise precaution
of erecting extra barriers across the street, much mischief would
have been done in the confusion.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the poor woman were momentary.&mdash;When she
was brought into the dock, at the bottom of the stairs leading to
the scaffold, she took a seat on a bench. Mr. Baker attended her,
while Mr. Cotton attended White on the scaffold. Her eyes were
closed, and her resignation was surprising. She ejaculated, “Into
thy hands, oh Lord! I commit my soul;” and just before she
ascended the scaffold, she said, “God have mercy, save my soul!
and pity and pardon my poor friend Patrick” (alluding to Riley).
Whilst on the scaffold, she continued praying, in which she was in
some degree disturbed by the extraordinary conduct of her fellow
culprit.</p>

<p>The crowd were greatly affected by the horrid sight which they
had witnessed, and we trust that this example will have its due
effect upon the minds of the thoughtless and wicked.</p>

<img class="wordpicture" src="images/william-corder.jpg" width="442" height="40" alt="WILLIAM CORDER," /><br />
THE MURDERER OF MARIA MARTEN.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the tragical affair between Thurtell and Weare,
no event has occurred connected with the criminal
annals of our country which has excited so much
interest as the trial of Corder, who was justly convicted
of the murder of Maria Marten on Friday last.</p>

<h4>THE CONFESSION.</h4>

<p class="right">“Bury Gaol, August 10th, 1828.&mdash;Condemned cell.</p>

<p class="right">“Sunday evening, half-past Eleven.</p>

<p>“I acknowledge being guilty of the death of poor
Maria Marten, by shooting her with a pistol. The
particulars are as follows:&mdash;When we left her father’s
house, we began quarrelling about the burial of the
child: she apprehended the place wherein it was
deposited would be found out. The quarrel continued
about three quarters of an hour upon this sad and
about other subjects. A scuffle ensued, and during the
scuffle, and at the time I think that she had hold of me,
I took the pistol from the side pocket of my velveteen
jacket and fired. She fell, and died in an instant. I
never saw her even struggle. I was overwhelmed with
agitation and dismay:&mdash;the body fell near the front
doors on the floor of the barn. A vast quantity of
blood issued from the wound, and ran on to the floor
and through the crevices. Having determined to bury
the body in the barn (about two hours after she was
dead. I went and borrowed a spade of Mrs Stow, but
before I went there I dragged the body from the barn
into the chaff-house, and locked the barn. I returned
again to the barn, and began to dig a hole, but the
spade being a bad one, and the earth firm and hard, I
was obliged to go home for a pickaxe and a better
spade, with which I dug the hole, and then buried the
body. I think I dragged the body by the handkerchief
that was tied round her neck. It was dark when I
finished covering up the body. I went the next day,
and washed the blood from off the barn-floor. I declare
to Almighty God I had no sharp instrument about me,
and no other wound but the one made by the pistol was
inflicted by me. I have been guilty of great idleness,
and at times led a dissolute life, but I hope through the
mercy of God to be forgiven. <span class="smcap">William Corder.</span>”</p>

<p class="right">Witness to the signing by the said William Corder,
<span class="smcap">John Orridge.</span></p>

<p class="right">Condemned cell, Eleven o’clock, Monday morning,
August 11th, 1828.</p>

<p>The above confession was read over carefully to the
prisoner in our presence, who stated most solemnly it
was true, and that he had nothing to add to or retract
from it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Stocking</span>, chaplain; <span class="smcap">Timothy R. Holmes</span>,
Under-Shertff.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>At ten minutes before twelve o’clock the prisoner was
brought from his cell and pinioned by the hangman,
who was brought from London for the purpose. He
appeared resigned, but was so weak as to be unable to
stand without support; when his cravat was removed
he groaned heavily, and appeared to be labouring under
great mental agony. When his wrists and arms were
made fast, he was led round twards the scaffold, and
as he passed the different yards in which the prisoners
were confined, he shook hands with them, and speaking
to two of them by name, he said, “Good bye, God
bless you.” They appeared considerably affected by
the wretched appearance which he made, and “God
bless you!” “May God receive your soul!” were
frequently uttered as he passed along. The chaplain
walked before the prisoner, reading the usual Burial
Service, and the Governor and Officers walking immediately
after him. The prisoner was supported to the
steps which led to the scaffold; he looked somewhat
wildly around, and a constable was obliged to support
him while the hangman was adjusting the fatal cord.
There was a barrier to keep off the crowd, amounting
to upwards of 7,000 persons, who at this time had
stationed themselves in the adjoining fields, on the
hedges, the tops of houses, and at every point from
which a view of the execution could be best obtained.
The prisoner, a few moments before the drop fell,
groaned heavily, and would have fallen, had not a
second constable caught hold of him. Everything
having been made ready, the signal was given, the
fatal drop fell, and the unfortunate man was launched
into eternity. Just before he was turned off, he said in
a feeble tone, “I am justly sentenced, and may God
forgive me.”</p>

<h4>BURKING AND BURKERS.</h4>

<p>The month of November, 1831, will be recorded in
the annals of crimes and cruelties as particularly preeminent,
for it will prove to posterity that other
wretches could be found base enough to follow the
horrid example of Burke and his accomplice Hare, to
entice the unprotected and friendless to the den of
death for sordid gain.</p>

<p>The horrible crime of “Burking,” or murdering the
unwary with the intention of selling their bodies at a
high price to the anatomical schools, for the purpose of
dissection, has unfortunately obtained a notoriety which
will not be soon or easily forgotten. It took its horrifying
appellation from the circumstances which were
disclosed on the trial of the inhuman wretch Burke,
who was executed at Edinburgh in 1829, for having
wilfully and deliberately murdered several persons for
the sole purpose of profiting by the sale of their dead
bodies.</p>

<h4>APPREHENSION OF THE
BURKERS.</h4>

<p>On Tuesday, November 8th, four persons, viz., John
Bishop, Thomas Williams, James May, and Michael
Shield, were examined at Bow Street Police Office on
the charge of being concerned in the wilful murder of
an unknown Italian boy. From the evidence adduced,
it appeared that May, <i>alias</i> Jack Stirabout, a known
resurrection-man, and Bishop, a body-snatcher, offered
at King’s College a subject for sale, Shield and
Williams having charge of the body in a hamper, for
which they demanded twelve guineas. Mr Partridge,
demonstrator of anatomy, who, although not in absolute
want of a subject, offered nine guineas, but being struck
with its freshness sent a messenger to the police station,
and the fellows were then taken into custody, examined
before the magistrates, when Shield was discharged and
the others ultimately committed for trial.</p>

<h4>THE TRIAL.</h4>

<p>Friday, December 2nd, having been fixed for the
trial of the prisoners charged with the murder of the
Italian boy, the Court was crowded to excess so early
as eight o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock the Deputy Recorder, Mr Serjeant
Arabin, came into the court, when the prisoners
severally pleaded “Not Guilty.”</p>

<p>The Jury were then sworn, and at ten o’clock Chief
Justice Tindal, Mr Baron Vaughan, and Mr Justice Littledale
entered the Court, with the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs.</p>

<p>The Bench was crowded with persons of rank,
amongst whom was the Duke of Sussex.</p>

<p>Mr Bodkin having opened the case, Mr Adolphus
proceeded to state to the Jury the leading facts, as they
were afterwards stated in the evidence produced. The
case for the prosecution having closed, the prisoners
were called upon for their defence.</p>

<p>The prisoner Bishop in his defence stated that he
was thirty-three years of age, and had followed the
occupation of carrier till the last five years, during
which he had occasionally obtained a livelihood by
supplying surgeons with subjects. He most solemnly
declared that he had never disposed of any body that
had not died a natural death.</p>

<p>Williams’ defence briefly stated that he had never
been engaged in the calling of a resurrectionist, but
had only by accident accompanied Bishop on the sale of
the Italian boy’s body.</p>

<p>May, in his defence, admitted that for the last six
years he had followed the occupation of supplying the
medical schools with anatomical subjects, but disclaimed
ever having had anything to do with the sale of bodies
which had not died a natural death. That he had
accidentally met with Bishop at the Fortune of War
public house on the Friday on which the body was
taken for sale to Guy’s Hospital.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the jury retired to consider their
verdict, and on their return they found the prisoners
were Guilty of Murder.</p>

<p>The Recorder then passed the awful sentence upon
them, “That each of them be hanged on Monday
morning, and their bodies be delivered over for dissection
and anatomization.”</p>

<p>The prisoners heard the sentence as they had the
verdict, without any visible alteration. May raised his
voice, and in a firm tone said, “I am a murdered man,
gentlemen.”</p>

<h4>THE FULL CONFESSION OF
BISHOP AND WILLIAMS.</h4>

<p>On Saturday morning Williams addressed a note to
Mr Wontner, stating that he and Bishop wanted
particularly to see him and Dr. Cotton, the Ordinary.
In the course of the interview which immediately
followed, both prisoners made a full confession of their
guilt, both exculpating May altogether from being party
to any of the murders. Having received the confessions,
Mr Wontner immediately waited upon Mr Justice
Littledale and Baron Vaughan, and upon communicating
to them the statements, they said they would at once
see the Home Secretary on the subject.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning the Sheriffs visited all three of
the prisoners in succession, and with the Under-Sheriffs
were engaged between three and four hours in taking
down the statements of the convicts. The result of all
these investigations was that the same afternoon a
respite during his Majesty’s pleasure arrived at Newgate
for May, and his sentence will be commuted to
transportation for life.</p>

<h4 class="larger">THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>During the whole of Sunday crowds of persons congregated
in the Old Bailey, and the spot on which the
scaffold was to be erected was covered with individuals
conversing on the horrid crimes of the convicts, and in
the course of the day strong posts were erected in the
Old Bailey and at the ends of Newgate street, Giltspur
street, and Skinner street, for the purpose of forming
barriers to break the pressure of the crowd.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve o’clock the gallows was brought
out from the yard, and drawn to its usual station
opposite the Debtor’s door. The crowd, as early as one
o’clock amounting to several thousand persons, continued
rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>By some oversight three chains had been suspended
from the fatal beam, and this led the crowd to suppose
that May had not been respited. Mr. Wontnor, on
hearing of the mistake, directed that one of the chains
should be removed. The moment this was done an
exclamation of “May is respited,” ran through the
crowd, and, contrary to the expected tokens of indignation,
distinct cheers were heard amongst the crowd on
witnessing this token that mercy had been shown to
May.</p>

<p>At half-past seven the Sheriffs arrived in their
carriage, and in a short time the press-yard was
thronged with gentlemen. The unhappy convicts were
now led from their cells. Bishop came out first, and
after he was pinioned he was conducted to a seat, and
the Rev. Mr. Williams sat alongside of him, and they
conversed together in a low tone of voice.</p>

<p>Williams was next introduced, and the wonderful
alteration two days had effected in his appearance
astonished everyone who was present at the trial. All
the bold confidence he exhibited then had completely
forsaken him, and he looked the most miserable wretch
it is possible to conceive. He entered the room with a
very faltering step, and when the ceremony of pinioning
him commenced, he was so weak as to be scarcely
able to stand.</p>

<p>Everything being ready, the melancholy procession
moved forward. Bishop was then conducted to the
scaffold, and the moment he made his appearance the
most dreadful yells and hootings were heard among the
crowd. The executioner proceeded at once to the performance
of his duty, and having put the rope round
his neck and affixed it to a chain, placed him under the
fatal beam. Williams was then taken out, and the
groans and hisses were renewed. The dreadful preparations
were soon completed, and in less than five
minutes after the wretched men appeared on the scaffold
the usual signal was given, the drop fell, and they were
launched into eternity. Bishop appeared to die very
soon, but Williams struggled hard. Thus died</p>

</div>

<p>On the 22nd of April, James Greenacre was found guilty of the
wilful murder of Hannah Brown, and Sarah Gale with being accessary
after the fact. A long and connected chain of evidence was produced,
which showed, that the sack in which the body was found
was the property of Mr. Ward; that it was usually deposited in a
part of the premises which led to the workshop, and could without
observation have been carried away by him; that the said sack
contained several fragments of shavings of mahogany, such as
were made in the course of business by Ward; and that it
contained some pieces of linen cloth, which had been patched with
nankeen; that this linen cloth matched exactly with a frock which
was found on Greenacre’s premises, and which belonged to the
female prisoner. Feltham, a police-officer, deposed, that on the
25th of March he apprehended the prisoners at the lodgings of
Greenacre; that on searching the trowsers pockets of that person,
he took therefrom a pawnbroker’s duplicate for two silk gowns,
and from the fingers of the female prisoner two rings, and also a
similar duplicate for two veils, and an old-fashioned silver watch,
which she was endeavouring to conceal; and it was further
proved that these articles were pledged by the prisoners, and that
they had been the property of the deceased woman.&mdash;Two surgeons
were examined, whose evidence was most important, and whose
depositions were of the greatest consequence in throwing a clear
light on the manner in which the female, Hannah Brown, met
with her death. Mr. Birtwhistle deposed, that he had carefully
examined the head; that the right eye had been knocked out by a
blow inflicted while the person was living; there was also a cut on
the cheek, and the jaw was fractured, these two last wounds were,
in his opinion, produced after death; there was also a bruise on the
head, which had occurred after death; the head had been separated
by cutting, and the <i>bone sawed nearly through</i>, and then broken
off; there were the marks of a saw, which fitted with a saw which
was found in Greenacre’s box. Mr. Girdwood, a surgeon, very
minutely and skilfully described the appearances presented on the
head, and showed incontestibly, that the head had been severed
from the body <i>while the person was yet alive</i>; that this was proved
by the retraction, or drawing back, of the muscles at the parts where
they were separated by the knife, and further, by the blood-vessels
being empty, the body was drained of blood. This part of the
evidence produced a thrill of horror throughout the court, but
Greenacre remained quite unmoved.</p>

<p>After a most impressive and impartial summing up by the learned
Judge, the jury retired, and, after the absence of a quarter of an
hour, returned into court, and pronounced a verdict of “Guilty”
against both the prisoners.</p>

<p>The prisoners heard the verdict without evincing the least
emotion, or the slightest change of countenance. After an awful
silence of a few minutes, the Lord Chief Justice said they might
retire, as they would be remanded until the end of the session.</p>

<p>They were then conducted from the bar, and on going down the
steps, the unfortunate female prisoner kissed Greenacre with every
mark of tenderness and affection.</p>

<p>The crowd outside the court on this day was even greater than
on either of the preceding; and when the result of the trial was
made known in the street, a sudden and general shout succeeded,
and continued huzzas were heard for several minutes.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>At half past seven the sheriff arrived in his carriage, and in a
short time the press-yard was thronged with gentlemen who had
been admitted by tickets. The unhappy convict was now led from
his cell. When he arrived in the press-yard, his whole appearance
pourtrayed the utmost misery and spirit-broken dejection; his
countenance haggard, and his whole frame agitated; all that self-possesion
and fortitude which he displayed in the early part of his
imprisonment, had utterly forsaken him, and had left him a victim
of hopelessness and despair. He requested the executioner to give
him as little pain as posiible in the process of pinioning his arms
and wrists; he uttered not a word in allusion to his crime; neither
did he make any dying request, except that his spectacles might be
given to Sarah Gale; he exhibited no sign of hope; he showed no
symptom of reconciliation with his offended God! When the
venerable ordinary preceded him in the solemn procession through
the vaulted passage to the fatal drop, he was so overcome and
unmanned, that he could not support himself without the aid of the
assistant executioner. At the moment he ascended the faithless
floor, from which he was to be launched into eternity, the most
terrific yells, groans, and cheers were vociferated by the immense
multitude surrounding the place of execution. Greenacre bowed to
the sheriff, and begged he might not be allowed to remain long in the
concourse; and almost immediately the fatal bolt was withdrawn,
and, without a struggle, he became a lifeless corse.&mdash;Thus ended
the days of Greenacre, a man endowed with more than ordinary
talents, respectably connected, and desirably placed in society; but
a want of probity, an absolute dearth of principle, led him on
from one crime to another, until at length he perpetrated the
sanguinary deed which brought his career to an awful and disgraceful
period, and which has enrolled his name among the most
notorious of those who have expiated their crime on the gallows.</p>

<p>On hearing the death-bell toll, Gale became dreadfully agitated;
and when she heard the brutal shouts of the crowd of spectators,
she fainted, and remained in a state of alternate mental agony and
insensibility throughout the whole day.</p>

<p>After having been suspended the usual time, his body was cut
down, and buried in a hole dug in one of the passages of the prison,
near the spot where Thistlewood and his associates were
deposited.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>THE VERDICT.</h4>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Old Bailey, Saturday Evening,</span>
<i>June 20th, 1840.</i></p>

<p>After the jury had been absent for an hour and twenty minutes,
they returned into court, and the prisoner was again placed at the
bar.</p>

<p>The names of the jury were then called over, and the clerk of
the court said&mdash;“How say you, gentlemen, have you agreed on
your verdict? Do you find the prisoner Guilty or Not Guilty of
the felony of murder with which he stands charged?”</p>

<p>The foreman of the jury, in a low voice, said&mdash;“We find him
GUILTY!”</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Court then said: François Benjamin Courvoisier,
you have been found Guilty of the wilful murder of
William Russell, Esq., commonly called Lord William Russell;
what have you to say why the court should not give you sentence
to die according to law?</p>

<p>The prisoner made no reply. The usual proclamation for silence
was then made.</p>

<h4>SENTENCE.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Justice Tindal</span>, having put on the black
cap, said: François Benjamin Courvoisier, you have been found
guilty by an intelligent, patient, and impartial jury of the crime of
wilful murder. That crime has been established against you, not
indeed by the testimony of eye-witnesses as to the fact, but by a
chain of circumstances no less unerring, which have left no doubt
of your guilt in the minds of the jury, and all those who heard the
trial. It is ordained by divine authority that the murderer shall
not escape justice, and this ordination has been exemplified in your
case, in the course of this trial, by the disclosure of evidence
which has brought the facts to bear against you in a conclusive
manner. The murder, although committed in the dark and silent
hour of night, has nevertheless been brought clearly to light by
Divine interposition. The precise motive which induced you to
commit this guilty act can only be known to your own conscience;
but it now only remains for me to recommend you most earnestly
to employ the short time you have to live in prayer and repentance,
and in endeavouring to make your peace with that Almighty Being
whose law you have broken, and before whom you must shortly
appear. The Learned Judge then passed sentence on the prisoner
in the usual form.</p>

<p>The court was very much crowded to the last.</p>

<h4>THE CONFESSION OF THE CONVICT.</h4>

<p>After the Learned Judge had passed sentence on the convict,
he was removed from the bar, and immediately made a full confession
of his guilt.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>At eight o’clock this morning, Courvoisier ascended the steps
leading to the gallows, and advanced, without looking round him,
to the centre of the platform, followed by the executioner and the
ordinary of the prison, the Rev. Mr Carver. On his appearance a
few yells of execration escaped from a portion of the crowd; but
the general body of the people, great as must have been their
abhorrence of his atrocious crime, remained silent spectators of the
scene which was passing before their eyes. The prisoner’s manner
was marked by an extraordinary appearance of firmness. His step
was steady and collected, and his movements free from the slightest
agitation or indecision. His countenance indeed was pale, and bore
the trace of much dejection, but it was at the same time calm and
unmoved. While the executioner was placing him on the drop
he slightly moved his hands (which were tied in front of him, and
strongly clasped one within the other) up and down two or three
times; and this was the only visible symptom of any emotion
or mental anguish which the wretched man endured. His face was
then covered with the cap, fitting so closely as not to conceal the
outlines of his countenance, the noose was then adjusted. During this
operation he lifted up his head and raised his hands to his breast,
as if in the action of fervent prayer. In a moment the fatal bolt
was withdrawn, the drop fell, and in this attitude the murderer
perished. He died without any violent struggle. In two minutes
after he had fallen his legs were twice slightly convulsed, but no
further motion was observable, excepting that his raised arms,
gradually losing their vitality, sank down from their own lifeless
weight.</p>

<p>After hanging one hour, the body was cut down and removed
within the prison.</p>

For the Wilful Murder of JAMES BURDON,<br />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/divider-horizontal-1.jpg" width="250" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This morning soon after eight o’clock, Robert
Blakesley was executed in the Old Bailey for the
murder of James Burdon, on the 21st of September, by
stabbing him on the left side of his belly. The prisoner
was tried at the Central Criminal Court before
Lord Abinger and Mr Baron Gurney. Mr Payne
appeared for the prosecution. Mr C. Phillips and
Bodkin conducted the defence. The Jury after an
absence of half an hour returned into court finding the
Prisoner GUILTY. The officer of the court then
asked the prisoner if he had anything thing to say why
sentence of death should not be passed upon him?</p>

<p>The Prisoner: So help me God I am innocent of all
intention to murder James Burdon.</p>

<p>Proclamation was then made to keep silence in the
court.</p>

<p>Lord Abinger, having put on the black cap, addressed
the prisoner as follows:&mdash;Robert Blakesley, you stand
convicted by a jury of your countrymen of the atrocious
and abominable crime of murder. Though you appeal
to God to bear witness of your innocence, yet it is by
human tribunals that you must be judged. If you are
innocent God will not hear that appeal in vain, but we
can judge only by human testimony, and the means we
have of investigating guilt. Upon that investigation
no doubt can be entertained that you are guilty of the
crime laid to your charge. You intended to commit
another murder; the first person whose life you aimed
at taking away was your wife. You then aimed at
taking away that of the unfortunate man who became
the victim of your anger, and his life has been taken
by you, who gave it not, and who cannot restore it.
You have, to a certain extent, by your remorse, appeared
conscious of your offence. It is impossible for me,
sitting in this place, to take any other notice of that
remorse than to express a hope that it may be genuine,
and that you may, in the short time you have to pass in
this world, endeavour to make your peace with God,
whose laws in this life you have violated by your crime.
An attempt has been made to excuse you on the ground
of temporary insanity. You have had a merciful and
deliberate jury, who have paid the greatest attention to
to the evidence adduced before them upon that subject,
and your own father, who appears to be a person highly
respectable, has come forward to endeavour to prove
that, as far as he could do so consistently with the truth
on your behalf. But, notwithstanding, all the inclination
which the jury must have felt to yield, if possible,
to the anxious wish of your parent, we have all found
it impossible to doubt that you committed this act with
malice, with deliberation, and with an intention you
had no right or authority to feel, much less to execute.
You have taken away the life of one of your fellow-creatures;
another, that of your own wife, still remains
in jeopardy. What can you expect from human
tribunals but that the law should be executed with the
utmost severity against you? Its sentence, and I
pronounce it with pain and sorrow, is, that you be taken
to the place whence you came, to be thence removed to
the place of execution, then that you be hanged by the
neck till you are dead, and that your corpse be buried
in the place of your imprisonment, and may the Lord
have mercy on your soul.</p>

<p>The prisoner, who had preserved the same coutenance
and demeanour unmoved, was then taken from the dock.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>The moment the culprit appeared on the scaffold,
there was a yell from the multitude, but he took no
notice of it, but muttering a few words in prayer, he
was launched into eternity. For the first couple of
minutes, the wretched man struggled very much, to the
great gratification of the crowd, at the pain he was
supposed to be suffering. After hanging the usual time,
the body was cut down, and deposited in a shell, in
which he is to be buried to-night within the precintes
of the gaol.</p>

<span class="smaller">AT</span><br />
<span class="larger">STANFIELD HALL.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Between 11 and 12 o’clock the bell of St Peter’s,
Mancroft, tolled the death knell of the criminal. When
conducted to the turnkey’s room to be pinioned he met
Calcraft, whereupon he said to Mr Pinson “Is this the
man that is to do the business?” The reply was “Yes.”
When he was pinioned he shrugged up his shoulders,
saying “This don’t go easy; it’s too tight.”</p>

<p>Within two or three minutes after 12 o’clock the
mournful cavalcade proceeded from the interior of the
Castle to the spot on which the gibbet was erected.
The chaplain, who headed the procession, read, as he
passed along, part of the burial service.</p>

<p>When the procession left the Castle gate to proceed
to the gibbet, Rush presented a most melancholy and
dejected appearance. He was dressed in a plain suit of
black, wearing no neck-hankerchief. His shirt collar
was turned down. For about twenty yards he walked
with a firm unwavering step, but in a moment afterwards
he raised his pinioned hands to his face and
trembled violently. He then removed his hands from
his face, and turning up his eyes to heaven, assumed
the attitude of penitence and prayer. On reaching the
gallows the rev. chaplain offered up a prayer. While
this prayer was being read the condemned convict
seemed to be deeply impressed with the awful character
of his situation. Immediately on the close of the
prayer he beckoned to Mr Pinson, the governor of the
Castle, when the following brief conversation ensued:</p>

<p>Rush: Mr Pinson, I have a last request to make to
you. It is that the bolt may be withdrawn while the
chaplain is reading the benediction&mdash;“The grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship
of the Holy Ghost, be with us all, evermore.”</p>

<p>Mr Pinson: I will communicate your wish to the
chaplain, and I have no doubt it will be attended to.</p>

<p>The hangman then placed the unhappy convict under
the beam on which he was to hang, and affixed the
fatal rope around his neck. Rush said, “For God’s
sake give me rope enough. Don’t be in a hurry; take
your time.” Then moving his head about, he said
“Put the knot a little higher up, don’t hurry.” The
rev. chaplain proceeded with the prayers, and on arriving
at the words “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,”
&amp;c., Calcraft withdrew the bolt, the platform went
down, and all was over. His death was greeted with
loud applause by an immense crowd who had assembled
to witness the execution.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the most appalling murders which has for
years startled and disgusted society took place on the
morning of Wednesday, March 28th, 1849, at No. 20,
Leveson Street, Liverpool, at mid-day. A miscreant in
the most brutal manner murdered two unprotected
women and two helpless children.</p>

<p>In due course Wilson was committed for trial, which
took place before Mr Justice Patteson and a respectable
jury, who, in less than five minutes, returned a verdict
of GUILTY.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, a few minutes before twelve
o’clock, the iron gate leading to the drop was opened,
and the prisoner appeared between two priests&mdash;the
Rev. Mr Duggan and the Rev. Mr Marshall. A general
feeling of horror seemed to pervade all present, which
found expression in the most distant part of the assemblage
by bursts of execration.</p>

<p>Calcraft, the London executioner, was unable to be
present from illness, and the office was performed by
Howard, from York, who was especially brought to
Liverpool by the Under Sheriff. The priests read in
English, the service of the Catholic Church for a
departing soul until the bolt was drawn, and the
wretched culprit was launched into eternity.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the life of one of the greatest
criminals that ever disgraced the human family. Upwards
of 100,000 persons were present, the railway
company running cheap trains from all available parts.</p>

For the MURDER and Robbery of PATRICK O’CONNOR.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This morning the last act in the tragedy of the
Mannings’ was performed on the roof of Horsemonger
Lane Gaol, in the presence of an immense assemblage.</p>

<p>The gardens in front of the houses opposite the prison,
and from which the best view could be obtained, commanded
high prices, and were occupied by persons of
apparent respectability, and amongst them were many
well-dressed females.</p>

<p>A few minutes before the clock struck nine, the bell
of the prison chapel was heard to give forth the fatal
toll, and those who had collected in the vicinity of the
scaffold were observed to uncover, which was taken up
by the populace below as a signal to do the same, and to
call for silence. Immediately the roar of voices which
had previously prevailed became hushed and still, and
the mournful cavalcade ascended the steps of the scaffold,&mdash;Calcraft
first, then the Chaplain, followed by the
wretched man Manning, who ascended the stairs with a
firm step, but appeared pale and emaciated. He was
dressed in deep black, with a long frock-coat. The
rope having been adjusted and the cap drawn over his
face, Mrs. Manning, the female partner in his crime was
brought up. She was dressed in black satin, tightly
bound round the waist, with a long white collar fastened
round her neck. On advancing up on the drop, and
observing her husband at her side, as if acting upon the
sudden impulse of the moment, she seized his right
hand and shook it for several minutes. The hangman
then hurriedly completed his deadly preparations, the
next minute the slam of the drop was heard, and the
dread sentence of the law had been accomplished.
Manning gave a few convulsive jerks, and all was over,
but his wife had a long struggle with death, and it was
some moments before the immortal spirit had quitted
her body for ever.</p>

<h4>Confession of the Murderess.</h4>

<p>The following confession was made by the murderess, to Mr. Biddlecombe, chief superintendent
of the Surrey Constabulary:-“On Friday last, I was bad all day; I wanted to see
Mr. Izod, and waited all day. I wanted him to give me some medicine. In the evening I
walked about, and afterwards put the children to bed, and wanted to go to sleep in a chair.&mdash;About
nine o’clock, Georgy (meaning Georgianna) kept calling me to bed. I came up to bed,
and they kept calling me to bring them some barley water, and they kept calling me till
nearly 12 o’clock. I had one candle lit on the chair&mdash;I went and got another, but could not
see, there was something like a cloud, and I thought I would go down and get a knife
and cut my throat, but could not see. I groped about in master’s room for a razor&mdash;I
could not find one&mdash;at last I found his keys, and then found his razor. I went up to
Georgy, and cut her first; I did not look at her. I then came to Carry, and cut her.
Then to Harry&mdash;he said, ‘don’t mother.’ I said, ‘I must’ and did cut him. Then I
went to Bill. He was fast asleep. I turned him over. He never awoke, and I served him
the same. I nearly tumbled into this room. The two children here, Harriet and George
were awake. They made no resistance at all. I then lay down myself.” This statement
was signed by the miserable woman.</p>

For the barbarous and cruel murder of his own wife.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The execution of William Cogan for the murder of
his wife took place this (Monday) morning at Newgate.
The circumstances under which the crime was committed
will be fresh in the recollection of the public.
The prisoner and his wife were in the habit of getting
drunk, and while in that state quarrels took place
between them. They had been to a funeral on the day
the occurrence took place, and they both drank freely,
and when they got home they quarrelled. About two
o’clock in the morning he rushed into the street with
his throat cut. The prisoner endeavoured to make it
appear that his wife had first cut his throat and then
destroyed herself. Ever since his condemnation the
culprit has continued to assert his innocence, and on
Friday last, when he parted for the last time with his
father and his sisters, he again positively declared he
was innocent. The condemned man slept soundly his
last night. On the fatal morning the executioner, Calcraft,
was admitted into the cell a few minutes before
eight o’clock, and the culprit the moment he entered
appeared to recognise him, and rose from his seat and
submitted to the operation of being pinioned with the
utmost composure; and just as the clock of St.
Sepulchre’s church chimed the hour the mournful procession
moved towards the scaffold. The culprit was
then placed under the fatal beam and the rope was
adjusted, and after the executioner had retired he
prayed most earnestly with the Ordinary for a short
time, and almost the last words he uttered were a prayer
to God to forgive him. The drop fell almost at the
same moment, and the wretched man, after one or two
convulsive struggles, ceased to exist. After hanging
an hour, according to the terms of the sentence, the
body was cut down and placed in a shell and removed
to the interior of the prison.</p>

<p>The crowd that was assembled to witness the execution,
was very great. During the whole of Sunday
afternoon the Old Bailey was thronged, and crowds of
persons had assembled so late as twelve o’clock at night,
some of whom remained until the period of the execution.
The officials of the prison stated that it was one
of the noisiest and most disorderly crowds they ever
remember to have seen upon a similar occasion. The
moment the wretched man made his appearance on the
scaffold there was a general cry of “hats off,” and the
upturned faces of the thousands of spectators presented
a most extraordinary spectacle. The culprit was twenty-six
years old, and he was apparently a strong muscular
man.</p>

<h3><a name="EXECUTION_OF_THE_WARWICKSHIRE_MURDERER" id="EXECUTION_OF_THE_WARWICKSHIRE_MURDERER"></a>EXECUTION OF THE WARWICKSHIRE MURDERER,<br />
<span class="larger">GEORGE GARDNER,</span><br />
<i>For shooting his sweetheart, Sarah Kirby</i>.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The condemned criminal, George Gardner, a ploughman,
on Monday suffered the last penalty of the law at
Warwick. The execution took place at ten o’clock,
before the county gaol, and was performed by Smith, of
Dudley. The murder was a most unprovoked and cold-blooded
one, by which Sarah Kirby, his fellow-servant,
was shot dead while she was standing at her washing-tub,
on the 23rd of April last. Both she and the man
Gardner were employed at a roadside farm, on the
confines of the county, and she was a very good-looking,
well-conducted, pious girl. He was a very
great blackguard and a sot. Soon after he went to the
farm where the murder took place she complained to
Miss Edge, the housekeeper, that he annoyed her very
much by his attentions, and his attempts to kiss her.
Mr Edge, her master, hearing of this, called them both
into the parlour, and told him he must not repeat his
conduct to her, whereupon Gardner said, “Well, if I
can’t have her, no one else shall.” No further complaints
were made after this, though there is reason to
believe he continued his suit. He amused himself by
looking at her as she undressed at night through a
chink in the wall which separated their bedrooms. The
only complaint he had against her was that she would
not draw him the proper quantity of beer; but the
truth was that he wanted more than his fair share. On
the morning of the murder he was at work in the
plough-field, his master being absent at a cattle fair,
and he made remarks to the other labourers which
showed him to be contemplating some act of violence,
saying he wished he had “some one” before him&mdash;he
would kill them, and so on; but he appears to have left
his work and returned to the house without causing
any suspicion to arise in their minds that he was about
to commit the crime of murder. Having reached the
house, he asked this poor girl to fetch him his master’s
double-barrelled gun for shooting rooks. He had been
in the habit of using it for this purpose before, and no
surprise was felt by the girl or by Miss Edge, the
housekeeper, who saw her hand the loaded gun to him,
Miss Edge remarking, “Mind, it is loaded, George.”
He said, “Yes, ma’am, I know it is,” and tried it by
taking off the cap and letting the hammer down.
Finding it all right, he followed Kirby to the wash-house,
and shot her in the back of the neck. He afterwards
threatened Miss Edge, and there is no doubt that
if she had not concealed herself he would have shot
her. He then escaped with the gun, and was taken by
the police on his way to Oxford. Some delay took
place in the execution; and from the bad adjustment of
the rope or some other cause, the criminal died very
hard, struggling much, until at last he hung motionless
in the air. The crowd contained a large proportion of
women, but was orderly in the extreme, and began to
disperse as soon as the drop fell. Gardner died penitent,
confessing his crime. The following confession was
made by Gardner before his execution:&mdash;“I did not
want to pay my addresses to Sarah Kirby, but she
would never draw me the proper quantity of beer, and
that vexed me. I did not know the master was away
on the 23rd of April, and the witness who said I asked
him where he was will have to suffer for his perjury.
I tried my luck in the field by throwing up the “spud”
of the plough, which came down with the point in the
earth. If it had fallen flat I should not have killed
her, but as it came down point foremost I left the field
with the determination to do it. I should have killed
Miss Edge if I had got near her, and it’s a good job no
one stopped me before I sold the gun.”</p>

<span class="larger">WILLIAM G. YOUNGMAN,</span><br />
The Walworth Murderer.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Thursday, August 16th, William Godfrey Youngman
was placed at the bar of the Central Criminal Court
to take his trial for the murder of his mother, two
brothers, and his sweetheart.&mdash;Shortly after ten o’clock
the learned judge, Mr Justice Wilhams, took his seat on the
bench. The prisoner, who was described as a tailor,
and 25 years of age, was then placed at the bar. He
exhibited perfect coolness and self-possession, and did
not seem in the slightest degree affected at his awful
position. The indictment that was proceeded with was
the one charging him with the wilful murder of his
sweetheart, Mary Wells Streeter.&mdash;Mr James Bevan
said: I reside at 16, Manor place, Walworth. The
prisoner’s father occupied the top floor of the house.
On the 31st of July his family consisted of his wife,
two little boys, the prisoner, and the deceased. I understand
the prisoner had come to see his father on a
holiday, and he would sleep there. About ten minutes
to 6 in the morning I was in bed, and heard a noise and
a heavy fall on the top floor of the house. I got up to
see what was the matter, and before I could get to the
door Mr Beard knocked at it and said, “For God’s sake
come here&mdash;here is murder.” I went upstairs directly,
and when I got to the top of the stairs I saw the elder
boy lying dead upon the landing, I did not see anything
more then, but went down and dressed myself,
and I then saw the prisoner standing in his nightshirt
on the staircase. He said to me “My mother has done
all this&mdash;she murdered my two brothers and my sweetheart,
and I, in self-defence, believe I have murdered
her.” I went out and fetched the police.&mdash;Susannah
Beard said: Me and my husband occupied the back
room as a sleeping room. About one o’clock in the
morning of the 31st of July, I heard a noise overhead
like something very heavy falling on the boards of the
bedroom above ours. My husband went out to see what
was the matter, and he called out “Murder!” and
came downstairs. He afterwards went up again with
the landlord. I went to the door of our room and saw
the prisoner standing on the staircase. He said, Mrs.
Beard, my mother has done all this. She has murdered
my sweetheart and my two little brothers, and I believe
in self-defence I have murdered her.”</p>

<p>Philip Beard, the husband of the last witness, said,
I had seen the prisoner in our house a few days. I
remember being awoke by my wife, and I heard a
rambling on the landing. The noise was like that of
children running about. I went out of my room, and
I heard a slight scream. When I got to the outside of
my room, I saw some blood on the stairs, and on the
top of the staircase I saw the little boy lying on the
landing. His throat was cut and he was dead. I then
saw the body of the deceased lying a little beyond that
of the boy. I did not observe any other bodies at the
time, as I was very much alarmed, and I went down
and called the landlord, and we went upstairs together;
and I went to dress. I then fetched a policeman and a
surgeon. I saw the prisoner upon the stairs, and he
told me that his mother had done it all, and that he
had murdered her in self-defence.</p>

<p>After the further examination of a number of witnesses,
who corroborated the evidence already given,
Mr. Best, in a powerful and touching speech, addressed
the jury for the prisaner.</p>

<p>The jury retired, and in about 25 minutes returned
into court, and amid breathless suspense gave a verdict
of Guilty.</p>

<p>The judge then put on the black cap, and delivered
the following sentence: Prisoner at the bar, you have
been convicted of the crime of murder, and one of the
most heinous ever committed, but it is no part of my
office to dwell on the enormity of your guilt. It is my
only duty to pass upon the sentence of the law, and
that sentence is&mdash;That you be taken to the prison from
whence you came, and then to the place of execution,
and there be hanged by the neck until you are dead.
May the Lord have mercy on your miserable soul!</p>

<h4>EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>Tuesday, September 4th, was the day appointed for
the execution of Youngman, the perpetrator of four
murders at Walworth. At an early hour people of the
lowest order began to assemble in the neighbourhood of
the prison, and by five o’clock every available space
was occupied. At seven o’clock the chaplain entered
the condemned cell to administer religious consolation
to the criminal, and remained with him until the time
of his execution. In reply to exhortations addressed to
him by the chaplain, he repeated substantially the story
he had always told as to his share in the crime. The
chaplain urged him not to leave the world with a lie in
his mouth. “Well, if I wanted to tell a lie it would
be to say that I did it.” He, nevertheless, conducted
himself towards the chaplain with respect, listened to
him with attention, and joined in prayer; but, beyond
those mechanical observances, he showed no evidence
whatever of feeling.</p>

<p>The minutes which remained to him to live might
now be numbered. He was then conducted to a gateway;
in which a corridor he had to traverse terminated,
and there, a few minutes before nine, he was pinioned.
The procession then formed, the gates were opened, the
chaplain commenced reading the burial service, and, so
escorted, the convict proceeded to the beam. On
arriving at the drop and confronting the mass of human
beings he looked wild and startled, but, recovering his
composure he allowed himself to be placed on the drop,
and, with evident fervency and an audible voice, he
followed the chaplain in a prayer, clasping his hands in
unmismakeable devotion. For a moment he paused to
request the exeeutioner, who was adjusting the noose,
to pinion his legs, which was done; and his parting
words addressed to the chaplain&mdash;were, “Thank you,
Mr. Jessop, for your great kindness; see my brother,
and take my love to him and all at home.”</p>

<p>The drop fell, and he died in a few minutes.</p>

<p class="center larger">EXAMINATION AND CONFESSION<br />
<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
JOHN HEALEY.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John Healey, who stands charged on his confession with having been concerned with
four others in the murder of James Barton, at the Button or Bawkhouse Pit, Haigh, near
Wigan, on the morning of the 3rd of January, 1863, was re-examined at Wigan, yesterday.
The confession having been read over, Mr. Lamb asked the prisoner if it was correct. He
said: it is not all correct, sir. I own to it that I had liquor with the men, but then I do not
recollect where I went.&mdash;Mr. Lamb: But that portion about the murder?&mdash;Healey: I can then
recollect the men and then getting drunk, but I do not know what occurred after.&mdash;Mr.
Lamb: Well, then, how was it that you made that statement?&mdash;A man may be in drink
and not know what he is doing.&mdash;Mr. Lamb: You were not in drink when you made the
statement.&mdash;The prisoner: No.&mdash;Mr. Lamb: Then how was it you made it? The prisoner
made no reply. Evidence was then tendered as to the discovery of the few remains of
Barton, but nothing fresh was elicited. The only evidence bearing upon the confession of
Healey, was that of Jane Little, a collier girl. She deposed that on the morning of the
murder she was assisting to load a boat with coal at the Bridge or Pigeon Pit, situated on the
canal bank, between the Bawkhouse Colliery and Wigan. The towering path was on the
opposite side of the canal to the colliery, and the path was lighted by a light on the pit bank.
About a quarter-past two she was in the boat, and a man, named Jordan, was above lowering
the coals. He was approaching with a full tub, when she saw four men come in the
direction of Haigh. Jordan was just lowering a tub as they came near, and when the men
saw him they stopped suddenly by a heap of ashes. Whilst he was fetching another tub
they walked sharply past and over the bridge, where they waited till Jordan had gone away
again. The men had caps on.&mdash;Having been charged in the usual way, the prisoner said he
had nothing to say, and he was committed for trial at the next Liverpool assizes.&mdash;The evidence
of Little is, so far as it goes, corroborative of Healey’s confession, and as it was never made
public till yesterday, there is no probability that the story of the prisoner with regard to the
four men can have been manufactured from the newspapers or from hearsay.</p>

<h3><a name="EXECUTION_BIGGADIKE" id="EXECUTION_BIGGADIKE"></a>EXECUTION<br />
<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
<span class="larger">PRISCILLA BIGGADIKE,</span><br />
at Lincoln, for the<br />
WILFUL MURDER OF HER HUSBAND.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Priscilla Biggadike, who was sentenced to death at
the recent Lincoln Assizes, for the wilful murder of her
husband by poisoning, at Stickney, a village near
Boston, in Lincolnshire, was executed on Monday
morning, at nine o’clock.</p>

<p>The unfortunate woman has appearod to pay considerable
attention to the ministrations of the chaplain,
but she declined to make any confession of her guilt.
On Saturday, she was visited by a brother and three
sisters, who remained with her upwards of three hours,
and strongly urged her to confess, but still she refused,
and at length became passionate at their repeated
entreaties. George Ironmonger, one of the persons
who lodged at her house, also applied for permission to
to see her on Saturday, but was refused.</p>

<p>On Sunday she attended Divine service in the prison.
She slept well during the night, and was visited at
seven o’clock yesterday morning by the Rev. W.
Richter, the chaplain, who again, without avail,
implored her to confess her guilt. At a quarter to
nine she was pinioned by Askerne the executioner, and
although she fainted under the operation, she immediately
recovered. Five minutes afterwards, the sad
procession left the prison for the scaffold, which was
erected within the castle walls, on the east side of the
Crown Court, a distance of nearly 200 yards from the
prison door.</p>

<p>The unfortunate woman, who was supported by two
of the warders, moaned piteously, and appeared to
take little heed of the chaplain, while reading the
solemn service of the dead. On her way to the place
of execution, she said to the warders, I hope my
trubles are ended, and then asked, ‘Shall we be much
longer?’ to which a warder gave a negative reply.
The service was brought to a close at the foot of a drop,
and the chaplain turning to the prisoner, asked her
whether she still persisted in the declaration of her
innocence? whether she had anything to do with the
crime, in thought, word, or deed? In a firm voice she
replied, ‘I had not, sir.’ She was then accommodated
with a chair, and the chaplain addressed her as follows:&mdash;I
have spent an half an hour with you this morning,
in endeavouring to impress upon you, a proper sense of
your condition, for you are about to pass from this
world into another, and to stand before God, to whom
the secrets of all hearts are known, I implore you not
to pass away without confessing all your sins; not only
generally, but especially this particular one, for which
you are about to suffer. I had hoped that you would
have made that confession, and thus have enabled me,
as a minister of Christ, to have pronounced the forgiveness
of your sins, under the promise that Christ came
into the world to save sinners. It has grieved me much
to find that still persist in the declaration, that you are
not accountable for your husband’s death; that you
still say that you did not administer the poison yourself;
that you did not see any other person administer it, and
that you are entirely free from the crime. Do you say
so, now?</p>

<p>The Prisoner, still in a firm voice, said, Yes.</p>

<p>The Chaplain.&mdash;There is only one left, that you
have endeavoured to confess your sins to God, though
you will not to you fellow creatures. All I can now
say is, that I leave you in the hands of God; and may
he have mercy on your soul. What a satisfaction it
would be to your children, to your friends, to your
relations, to know that you had passed from death into
life, in the full persuasion that your sins were forgiven
you, and that you were admitted into the blessed
kingdom of God. I fear that I can hold out no further
consolation to you&mdash;the matter rests between you and
the Almighty. Had you made a declaration of your
sins, I should have done what, as a minister of Christ,
I am entitled to do&mdash;I should have told you that “your
sins though many were forgiven.” I am sorry I cannot
exercise that authority at the present moment. I must
leave you to God.</p>

<p>The condemned woman was then assisted up the steps
to the platform, and placed on the trap door. When
the fatal rope was being affixed, she stood firm without
assistance. The cap was then drawn over her face, and
she the exclaimed “All my troubles are over;” then
suddenly “Shame, you are not going to hang me!”
“Surely my troubles are over.” The bell of the
cathedral here tolled forth the hour of nine, at that
instant the bolt was drawn, and the wretched woman
was launched into eternity.</p>

<p>This morning, the wretched criminal,
Frederick Baker, suffered the extreme penalty
of the law at Winchester Gaol, for the atrocious
murder of Fanny Adams, at Alton, on
the 24th of August last. It is satisfactory
to state that since his condemnation, the conduct
of the unhappy man underwent a total
change for the better, and he began to realize
the awful condition in which he was placed,
and his callous demeanour was changed into
one of deep dejection. The prisoner has
been assiduously attended by the chaplain of
the prison, and to such a state of religious
feeling had he been brought, that he fully
acknowledged the justice of his sentence.
The sheriffs arrived at an early hour. When
the operation of pinioning had been performed,
the wretched man thanked the
chaplain, the governor, and the other officials
for their kindness. The procession was then
formed, and slowly took its way towards the
scene of execution. The cap and rope was
adjusted, the bolt drawn, and the prisoner
was launched into eternity.</p>

<p class="hanging">For the Murder of Philip Trainer, of Darlington, and Hugh John
Ward, of Sunderland, in the County Prison, at Durham, on the
22nd instant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yesterday the two murderers, Dolan and
M’Conville, were executed within the precincts
of the goal at Durham. M’Conville, who
who was 23 years of age, worked as a furnace-man
at Darlington, and was convicted
of the murder of Philip Trainer, on the
30th of January last, Dolan murdered a
man named Hugh John Ward, at Sunderland,
on the 8th of last December. The
two convicts left the condemned cell shortly
after eight o’clock, each supported by a
couple of warders, and attended by the Rev.
Canon Consett and Rev. G. Waterton, Roman
Catholic priests. A procession, headed
by the under sheriff, moved to the west
wing of the prison, where the scaffold was
erected. The warders conducted the men
chained from their cells, and they were
taken through the corridors to the pinioning
room, where Calcraft commenced his duties.
Both men submitted quitetly, and prayed
unceasingly with the priests. Canon Consett
ministered to M’Conville, and the Rev. Waterton
to Dolan. At 6 minutes to eight
the prison bell began to toll, the hour had
scarcely struck before the outer door of the
pinioning room opened and the procession
issued into the inner court of the prison.
It passed along a narrow passage between
two wards and abruptly turning to the left,
come into the open work yard, where the
low gallows was erected. In passing
across the yard neither criminal seemed
to notice the slight swelling among
the cinders and gravel close to their
path, which indicated the spot where
their graves already dug were lightly covered
until the tenants for them were ready.
Close to the gallows Calcraft stepped forward
and conducted M’Conville under the beam.
The criminal was deadly pale, but with
upright bearing and steady steps advanced
without faltering, Calcraft completed his
work in full view of Dolan, who shuddered
perceptibly, but never ceased joining in the
prayers &amp; responses with the Rev. Waterton.
At length Calcraft finished with M’Conville,
and then conducted Dolan under the beam.
In a few seconds this convict was made fast
to the beam, the Clergy and Calcraft crept
off the drop, and while petitions for mercy
were spoken aloud by both the victims, the
bolt was drawn. Dolan died almost instantaneously,
but M’Conville struggled for
several seconds. After hanging an hour the
bodies were cut down, and an inquest was
held at eleven.</p>

<h3><a name="EXECUTION_WRIGHT" id="EXECUTION_WRIGHT"></a>CONFESSION AND EXECUTION OF<br />
<span class="wordpicture">SAMUEL WRIGHT,</span>
<img class="wordpicture" src="images/samuel-wright.jpg" width="411" height="40" alt="SAMUEL WRIGHT," /><br />
For the MURDER of MARIA GREEN.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At an early hour on Monday evening the people began to congregate
in front of the gaol and in the public-houses in the vicinity
of Horsemonger-lane Gaol, but as the night wore on they gradually
dispersed, until towards three o’clock there were only a few stragglers
to be seen. About this time the last of the barricades was
erected, and every precaution was taken to prevent any disturbance.
It had been reported to the prison authorities and the police that an
attempt would be made to rescue Wright, and in consequence 500
of the reserves from the A, C, H, K, L, M, and P divisions were on
the spot keeping the ground round the prison clear. The arrangements
made by Mr. Superintendent Bradford were well carried out
by his colleagues, Superintendents White, Bray, Payne, and Gibbs,
and Inspectors Silverton, Fyfe, and Turpin, As the hour for the
execution approached the crowd began to increase, but all maintained
the utmost decorum. At times men were seen pervading
the place with a flag, on which was printed in large letters “Man’s
Cry,” and several religious extracts, while some of them read
aloud from the Scriptures. After them followed a number of
young men singing psalms, the tunes of which were taken up by
the populace.</p>

<p>As the hour of seven o’clock approached, the public-houses on
each side of the gaol were cleared of their customers, and the doors
and windows entirely closed, and at Mrs. Wrangham’s, the Masons’
Arms, a number of policemen took their station on the leads at the
back and front of the house. When daylight began to break the
morning was chilly, damp, and foggy; but, as the sun rose, it became
more cheerful, and it was then observed that nearly every
private house opposite the gaol had all the blinds down, as close
as if a person lay dead within. Very few of the windows were
occupied, and they seemed to be the inhabitants of the houses. The
gardens were kept clear by the police.</p>

<p>Great surprise was felt as the hour of execution arrived at finding
that there were so few persons to witness the awful tragedy.
Many had refused to stay, saying they would have no hand in the
murder of John Wright, and all felt that he was undergoing a
penalty that ought to have been remitted. There were not on the
whole more than 4,000 or 5,000 persons present, and being scattered
round the avenues leading to the place of execution, there was no
difficulty in walking about freely.</p>

<p>The unfortunate man slept soundly during the night, and rose
about six o’clock. He was visited by the chaplain, who remained
with him to the last.</p>

<p>Shortly before nine o’clock the governor of the gaol, Mr. Kean,
the sheriffs, Calcraft, and other authorities, entered the cell and
pinioned the culprit. They proceeded to the gallows, Wright
walking under the drop with a firm step, followed by Calcraft, a
warder, and the chaplain. He bowed to the crowd while the cap
was put over his head and the rope adjusted round his neck. There
were then loud shouts of “Shame,” “Murder,” “Disgraceful,”
“Townley,” and other manifestations of displeasure on the part of
the populace. Wright understood the feeling of sympathy in his
favour, and several times bowed his acknowledgments, raising his
hands spasmodically.</p>

<p>The fatal hour at length arrived, but there was some little delay
before the doomed man ascended the scaffold. Since his condemnation
he has behaved throughout with great decorum, and has
seen the members of his family several times. The Rev. Mr. Jessop,
the chaplain, has been unremitting in his attention to the unhappy
man, and his ministrations have been received with the most happy
results. Wright, it appears, was brought up a Roman Catholic at
a place called Cossey, in Norfolk, and since he has been in prison
he has received a letter from the Roman Catholic priest of that
place, asking him not to desert the faith in which he was educated.
Mr. Jessop asked him if he would like to see the Rev. Dr. Doyle,
a Catholic priest, but he was perfectly satisfied with the instruction
he was receiving from the chaplain. He took the sacrament on
Monday at his own request.</p>

<p>At length the fatal bolt was withdrawn, and in a few moments
the unhappy man was launched into eternity.</p>

<p>Wright saw his family and friends a few days ago, and took an
affecting leave of them. He has also written two letters, of which
the following are copies:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">“Jan. 10, 1864, Horsemonger-lane Gaol.</p>

<p>“Dear Mother,&mdash;I feel it my duty to write a few lines to you
before I leave this world, although it is under such painful circumstances.
Although I have not written to you before, you know
how I am situated. I never thought that I should add to your
sorrow. Dear mother, I call you by that name, for you have been
to me as one, and I may say I to you as a son. I received a kind
and welcome letter from Mr. Hazembeth, and was glad to hear that
my Cossey friends showed so much sympathy towards me. It is a
great crime that I have committed, and I feel that Almighty God
will forgive me, and then I hope to join them that’s gone before
me. Dear mother, it grieves me very much to think that my dear
children will be left fatherless and motherless, but there’s one above
that has promised to be a father to the fatherless.</p>

<p>“Since I have been here I have been treated with the greatest
kindness, and I am visited daily by the chaplain, from whom I feel
great comfort. I have but a few hours longer to live on this earth,
and they will be taken up with reading and prayer. Dear Polly is
quite well, and I will leave you to judge my parent’s care; I have
seen them several times, but my dear mother does not know that I
am condemned to die. I have had a great number of friends who
have tried to save me from this end, and have failed; but thank
God, I feel quite prepared to meet it. Dear mother, I conclude
with my kindest love to you and my dear daughter. May the
blessing of God Almighty be upon you now and for ever. No more
from your unfortunate son,</p>

<p>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Samuel Wright.</span>”</p>

<p class="right">“Jan. 11, 1864.</p>

<p>“Dear Mother,&mdash;I feel that I must write a few lines before I
leave this world, as Almighty God has given me strength so to do.
Dear Mother, although I am present here under a heavy crime, I
feel as if the Almighty God had freely forgiven me, after all my sins.
And what a blessing that is to think that your dear son feels so
glorified&mdash;that he dies in peace with God, where I hope to meet
them that are dear to us. I leave one with you, my dear child, in
remembrance of me, and may the Almighty God give you health
and strength to bring her up in the ways of the Lord. Dear
mother, I feel as if I cannot last but a few days longer, and now I
again take a farewell of father, mother, sisters, and brother, and
wishing the blessing of God Almighty may be upon you, now and
for ever, amen.</p>

<p>“Father’s blessing and a kiss for his child.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Samuel Wright.</span>”</p>

<p>He made a free confession of the whole of the shocking transaction.
He said he could not exactly say how the murder originated,
but it was something in this way: That he was asleep in bed, and
that the woman came and took him by the waistcoat and said he
should not lay sleeping there. Some words ensued, and she threatened
to leave him and go with some other man with whom she had
previously cohabited. Upon that he jumped out of bed, and as the
razor with which he had recently shaved himself was lying on the
table he took it up and cut her throat. It was all the work of a
moment. The father, the brother, and the brother’s wife saw him
for about an hour on Monday, and he has also seen his daughter, a
little girl about four years old.</p>

<p>He was aware of the efforts that were being made out of doors to
save his life, and appeared to feel very grateful to those who took
so kind an interest in him. Mr. S. Gurney, M.P., and Mr. J.
Phillips, one of the visiting justices, waited upon Mr Justice Blackburn
on Monday, and had an interview of about half an hour with
him, urging everything they could in Wright’s favour, but he
refused to accede to their request, and said the law must take its
course. Mr. Ebsworth, a surgeon, of Newington, took a petition
to her Majesty at Frogmore Lodge. While he was presenting the
petition to Colonel Knollys her Majesty passed up the stairs, and
he saw Colonel Knollys deliver it into the Queen’s hands, but the
answer he received to it was that the Queen could not undertake to
advise her advisers.</p>

<h3><a name="EXECUTION_CLITHEROE" id="EXECUTION_CLITHEROE"></a>THE EXECUTION OF<br />
<span class="larger">JAMES CLITHEROE,</span><br />
Of St. Helen’s, for the Murder of Mary Woods, this day.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img216.jpg" width="500" height="395" alt="" />
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>James Clitheroe, the culprit in this remarkable case, suffered death
on Saturday, in front of the Kirkdale gaol, near Liverpool, though
efforts had been made to secure a reprieve. The circumstances in
connexion are of a somewhat peculiar description. Clitheroe was a
married man with a family, but his affections appear to have been
divided between his wife and Mary Woods, a poor paralytic woman,
who earned a living by keeping a school and selling small beer. The
prisoner was in the habit of sharing the murdered woman’s bed, and
as his neighbours knew of this he was twitted by them, in the intensely
acrimonious manner peculiar to vulgar and uneducated people, as to
“the poor cripple Mary Woods” being <i>enciente</i> by him. This seems
to have annoyed Clitheroe very much, and his mortification and chagrin
acting upon a morbid temperament prompted him to murder. On the
night of the 28th of December last he visited Mary Woods’ house,
and went to bed with her as was his wont, but early next morning he
cut her throat and his own too, though the wound was only fatal in
the case of the woman. Later in the morning the school children
were unable to gain admission to the house as usual, and, as no one
answered the door after repeated knocks, an entrance was effected at
the rear of the premises, and an investigation took place. In an upstairs
room the police found Mary Woods and the prisoner in bed
together&mdash;the woman quite dead, and with her throat cut, and the
man in an exhausted condition, with his throat cut also. The blood
upon the woman’s throat was dry, and she had evidently been dead for
several hours; whereas the blood upon Clitheroe was fresh, and his
wound must have been recently inflicted, because the blood was flowing
freely from the arteries of the neck when the police first entered. The
prisoner, when asked what he had been doing, stated that he and Mary
Woods had agreed to cut their throats, saying, “We made it up to cut
our throats, She told me that the razor was in the drawer, under the
looking-glass. I fetched the razor, got into bed, and first cut my own
throat.” The prisoner never deviated from this account of the transaction,
either before or after the trial, but it must have been untrue in
point of fact, because the strong and irresistible probability is, that
the woman’s throat was cut at five o’clock in the morning, and that
she was dead several hours before the prisoner made the attempt upon
his own life. When the prisoner was on his trial, Mr Justice Willes
directed the jury that if the prisoner counselled, assisted, or directed
the woman to destroy herself, he was guilty of murder.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>The culprit, who was pinioned by Calcraft in the usual way,
struggled hard. To the last he persisted in the story of suicide.
The crowd was not so great as had been expected.</p>

<p>After hanging the usual time, the body was cut down, and the crowd
soon after dispersed.</p>

<div class="verse">Muller he did state that he was going to emigrate</div>

<span class="larger">MULLER,</span><br />
FOR THE MURDER OF MR BRIGGS, IN A RAILWAY TRAIN.</h3>

<p>The clue to the murderer of Mr. Briggs was obtained as follows:&mdash;A little girl, the
daughter of a cabman, was playing with a small card box, such as jewellers put small trinkets
in, and upon exhibiting it to her father, he remembered the name of the jeweller with whom
the chain of the late Mr. Briggs had been exchanged, and upon questioning the girl, she said
that Franz Muller had given it her four days ago. Muller, who is a German, a tailor’s cutter,
had previously lived at the house of the cabman. The police were immediately communicated
with. On the box being shown to Mr. Death, he at once identified it. Mr. Death then
accompanied the cabman and the police to a cottage at Bow, where Muller had lived, and
upon seeing a photograph Muller had given the child, he at once recognised the features of
the man who changed the chain. The cabman identified the hat found in the railway carriage
as the one he had purchased for Muller about four months ago. Inquiries were made, and it
was ascertained that the suspected murderer had sailed for New York, on board the Victoria.
Inspector Tanner and other officers immediately started for New York, to await the arrival of
Victoria. The Victoria, after a passage of forty days, arrived on the 24th of August, when
Muller was arrested, and the missing property found in his possession. After certain forms
were gone through, Muller started for England, Sept. 3rd, on board the Etna, and arrived at
Queenstown on the 15th.</p>

<p>On Friday evening, September 16th, Muller arrived at Liverpool. Upon landing he was
taken to the central police-station, Liverpool, and there remained till seven o’clock on Saturday
morning. To avoid the crowd Inspector Tanner took the prisoner to Edgehill station. He
was taken to a private room till the arrival of the nine a.m. train from Lime-street, when he
walked between Inspector Tanner and Superintendent Wide to the carriage. When the
train moved off attempts were made at groaning, but cries of “Good bye, Muller,” prevailed.
At twenty-five minutes past three o’clock on Saturday afternoon the Liverpool express train
drew up to the ticket platform at the London and North Western Railway, near Camden
Town. Muller was taken to Bow-street police-station, and the charge formally entered
against him by Inspector Tanner.</p>

<img class="wordpicture" src="images/franz-muller.jpg" width="404" height="40" alt="FRANZ MULLER," /><br />
For the Murder of Mr. BRIGGS, November 14th, 1864.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At two o’clock on Saturday afternoon Sir George Grey returned
an answer to the memorial presented to him, praying for a respite
of the convict Muller, by the German Legal Protection Society.
Previous to the delivery of his decision he had a long conversation
with the Lord Chief Baron Pollock and Mr. Baron Martin, which
terminated in his arriving at the conclusion that the memorial did
not warrant his interfering with the verdict of the jury.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the receipt of the letter, Mr. Beard, with
Alderman Wilson, proceeded to communicate to Muller the result
of the efforts that had been made on his behalf. They were received
by Mr. Jonas, the governor of Newgate, who conducted
them to the condemned cell. They found the prisoner engaged in
writing. He immediately rose, and extended his hand to Mr.
Beard, who asked him how he was. The convict said, “I am very
well.” Mr. Jonas then informed the prisoner of the efforts that
had been made to save his life, and that Mr. Beard had just
received a reply from the Secretary of State, which he read to
him. At the conclusion the convict said, in a low voice, “I did
not expect anything else.” Mr. Beard then said to the prisoner,
“Did you know that any efforts had been made on your behalf?”
The prisoner replied, “Yes, I did think so.” Mr. Beard then
said, “Have you any statement that you wish to make?” The
prisoner, “No, nothing.” “Because,” continued Mr. Beard,
“now that all has been done that can be done for you, and there is
no hope in this world, if you have anything to acknowledge, you
had better do so.” In reply to this Muller said, “I should be a
very bad fellow if I had done it. I have no other statement to
make than that which I have already made.” Mr. Beard then
asked him if he had made his peace with God. The prisoner said,
“Yes;” and in every respect appeared resigned to his fate. Mr.
Beard then shook hands with him, and said, “Good-bye Muller;
God bless you;” The prisoner returned the pressure of his hand,
and was left to himself.</p>

<p>The prisoner on Sunday attended Divine service in the chapel,
both in the morning and the afternoon, and listened apparently
with deep attention to the discourse delivered by the Rev. Mr.
Davis, the Ordinary. He was visited in the evening by Dr.
Walbaum and Dr. Cappell.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h4>PREPARATIONS FOR THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>Up to Sunday night Muller preserved the same quiet, firm demeanour,
and although he occupied some of his time in writing, he
did not lie down till considerably after his usual time, and slept but
little. He rose at five o’clock on Monday in good spirits, and was
soon afterwards joined by the Rev. Mr. Davis, the chaplain of the
gaol, and the Rev. Mr. Walbaum. He in every respect appeared
calm and resigned to meet his fate. He joined devoutly in prayer
with the rev. gentleman, and otherwise conducted himself in a
manner becoming his awful position. A little before seven o’clock
he was visited by Mr. Jonas, the governor of the gaol, to whom he
extended his hand, and feelingly thanked him for the kind attention
he had received since his incarceration. Calcraft arrived at six,
but was not recognised by the mob, and thus escaped the usual
hooting.</p>

<p>Although the fixing of the scaffold was completed by four o’clock,
still the clang of hammers in putting up barriers continued till day
had dawned.</p>

<p>At five o’clock a heavy drenching rain set in, which had the effect
of driving the majority of those who during the night had taken up
positions, from their strongholds, and to hastily beat a retreat to
the now open public-houses and coffee-shops, as well as to other
places offering anything like shelter. At this time there could not
have been more than five hundred people actually upon the scene.
But at six o’clock the rain abated, and from this time the crowd
was recruited by an increasing flow of new comers.</p>

<p>At six o’clock the main body of police, under Mr. Inspector
Duddy, was stationed at the approaches to, and in the Old Bailey,
and preserved throughout the morning in the strictest order.</p>

<p>Soon after seven o’clock, Mr. Alderman and Sheriff Besley, Mr.
Alderman and Sheriff Dakin, and the Under Sheriffs, Messrs.
Davidson and De Jersey, arrived at the Sessions House, where they
remained until summoned to the prison by the governor. About
twenty minutes to eight they were informed that the condemned
man would soon leave his cell. Upon receiving this intimation
these officials left the Sessions House. A few minutes after this,
the procession reached the door which opens into the chapel-yard.
Here they awaited the arrival of the culprit.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>While the officials were on their way from the Sessions House
to this spot, Mr. Jonas had gone to the cell of the prisoner, and
informed him that it was time for him to leave. The prisoner,
who was deadly pale, trembled with emotion, but sought to bear
the awful announcement with all the fortitude possible. He rose
up, shook hands with the gaolers who had been principally with
him since his incarceration, and with a firm and rather quick step
left his cell, accompanied by Mr. Jonas, followed by two or three
other officials. As soon as they left the cell the shouts and cries of
“They are coming,” “They are coming,” “Hats off.” At this
moment the most intense excitement and confusion prevailed, in
the midst of which terrible din reverberated the echoes of the
solemn knell, which, from its increased rapid tolling, indicated that
the mournful procession had gained the steps of the hideous, cloth-draped
gibbet. A moment afterwards Calcraft, the hangman, made
his appearance on the scaffold, and then withdrew to see that all
was right. He had no sooner disappeared than Muller, accompanied
by the Rev. J. Davis, chaplain, and Dr. Cappell, followed
by other officials, made his appearance. This was a signal for the
renewed excitement and clamour of the swerving multitude, who
had largely, and as it were imperceptibly increased, and whose upturned
anxious faces met the gaze at all points.</p>

<p>The culprit ascended the scaffold with a firm step, and placed
himself under the drop. He cast his eyes once up towards the
beam, and his lips quivered with emotion, but this he evidently
sought to check. After the cap had been drawn over his head and
the rope put round his neck, Dr. Cappell took hold of his hand and
again prayed with him. This he did for some minutes, and concluded
by addressing the following words to the now fast dying
man:&mdash;“In a few moments you will be before your God. I ask
you, for the last time, are you innocent or guilty?”</p>

<p>Muller: I am innocent.</p>

<p>Dr. Cappell: You are innocent?</p>

<p>Muller: God Almighty knows what I have done.</p>

<p>Dr. Cappell: Does God know that you have done this deed?</p>

<p>Muller was silent.</p>

<p>Dr. Cappell: I ask you now, solemnly, and for the last time,
have you committed this crime?</p>

<p>Muller: <span class="smcap">Yes, I have done it.</span></p>

<p>Almost at the same instant, and while the words were upon the
lips of the wretched man, the drop fell, and Muller died without a
struggle.</p>

<p>Dr. Cappell nearly fainted.</p>

<p>Immediately after the execution the sheriffs despatched a communication
to Sir George Grey, informing him that the culprit had
confessed. A similar communication was made to Sir R. Mayne, at
Scotland-yard.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The following despatch was immediately after the execution forwarded
to the Home Secretary:&mdash;</p>

you that the prisoner Muller has at the last moment, just before the
drop fell, confessed to the German minister of religion attending
him that he was guilty of the deed for which he suffered.</p>

</div>

<p>James Longhurst was executed this morning,
April 16, on the top of Horsemonger-lane
gaol. Since his condemnation he has
expressed contrition for his crime, and hoped
that God would forgive him. Notwithstanding,
the prisoner appearing to be in a state of
mind becoming his awful position, when he
was taken down from the condemned cell to
the yard to be pinioned, a frightful scene
ensued. The moment the culprit saw Calcraft,
the executioner, approach him with the
straps to pinion his arms, he started back with
an aspect of terror depicted on his countenance,
and began to struggle violently with the
turnkeys. The chaplain spoke to him and
endeavoured to calm him, and this for a
moment appeared to have the effect, but upon
the executioner requesting that the culprit
might be taken outside, as he could not see
to fasten the straps properly, another fearful
struggle ensued, and it required five warders
to hold him on the ground while he was being
pinioned, and one or two of the turnkeys
were very much hurt by the kicks they received.
The prisoner’s conduct seemed to
be actuated by an uncontrollable horror of
the executioner and the apparatus of death.
After he had been secured he walked quietly
by the side of the chaplain until he arrived
at the steps leading to the scaffold, and immediately
he caught sight of the gibbet his
horror appeared to return. He again struggled
violently as well as he was able, and was
forcibly dragged up to the steps and held
under the beam by several turnkeys while
the rope was adjusted round his neck, and as
speedily as possible the bolt was drawn, and
after a few struggles the wretched youth
ceased to exist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Friday, July 21st, Miss Constance E. Kent was placed at the Bar of the Salisbury
Assize Court, charged with the murder of her brother, Francis Saville Kent.</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Assize, addressing the prisoner, said: How say you, are you guilty or
not guilty? The prisoner in a voice scarcly audible, said&mdash;Guilty.</p>

<p>A profound silence then ensued in court, which was broken by Mr Coleridge, the prisoner’s
counsel, standing up and saying, I desire to say three things before your Lordship
pronounces sentence. First, solemnly before Almighty God, she wishes me to say that the
guilt is her own alone, and that her father and others, who have so long suffered most
unjust and cruel suspicions, are wholly and absolutely innocent; and secondly, that she
was not driven to this act by unkind treatment at home, as she met with nothing there but
tender and forbearing love, and I may add that it gives me a melancholy pleasure to be the
organ of these statements for her, because, on my honour, I believe them to be true.</p>

<p>The Judge, with much emotion, then said&mdash;Constance Kent, it is my duty to receive the
plea which you have deliberately put forward. I can entertain no doubt that the murder
was committed under great deliberation and cruelty. You appear to have allowed your
feelings and anger to have worked in your breast, until at last they assumed over you the
influence and power of the Evil One. It remains for me to pass the sentence which the law
adjudges. The learned Judge then passed upon her the usual Sentence of Death. During
the passing of the sentence, prisoner burst into a violent flood of tears, sobbing aloud.</p>

<span class="larger">STEPHEN FORWARD,</span><br />
For the Horrid Murder of THREE CHILDREN near Holborn, also of his WIFE

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>Murder of Three Children by Poison, near
Holborn.</h4>

<p>On Wednesday, August 9th, 1865, the neighbourhood
of Red Lion Square, was thrown into a state of
excitement owing to a report that three brothers had
been murdered at the Star coffee-house, Red Lion street.</p>

<p>It appears that on the Saturday, a man called at the
above hotel, and inquired if three children could be
accommodated with a bed for a few nights. Having
been informed that there was one room unoccupied, he
said the children were aged respectively six, eight, and
ten years, and that accommodation would be suitable.
He called again on the Monday evening with the three
children, and saw them to bed.</p>

<p>Half-past eight, when one of the chambermaids
entered the first room in which the two younger
children were in bed, and to her extreme horror found
they were dead. She immediately raised an alarm,
when the proprietor and others entered the room in
which the eldest child had been placed, and there
found that he also was in the sleep of death. Medical
assistance and the police were instantly summoned, the
surgeon firstly arriving, and upon his examination of
the bodies, pronounced life to have been extinct for some
hours, the limbs being rigid and cold.</p>

<p>From information gained by the police, it appears
that the person who left the children at the coffee house
went by the name of Southey.</p>

<h4 class="hanging">Murder of Mother &amp; Daughter at Ramsgate,
by the person who committed the other
Murders.</h4>

<p>On Thursday morning, August 10th, Ramsgate was
thrown into a state of intense excitement by a report
that a man named Stephen Forward had committed a
double murder in a dyer’s house in King street. It
appears that Forward, who was formerly a baker in the
town, left Ramsgate some eight years ago, leaving his
wife and a little girl behind him in a state of almost
total destitution. On Wednesday evening Forward
suddenly appeared in Ramsgate, and made his arrival
known to his wife. On Thursday morning, about
twenty minutes past eight, Forward went to Mr Ellis’s
house. His wife was there, having some breakfast
with Mr Ellis and his daughter. He was asked if he
would take any breakfast, but he declined. He sat
down and commenced talking. Shortly before nine
Ellis went into his workshop, and while there his
daughter told Forward and his wife if they had anything
to say in private they might go up stairs. They
both went up stairs, and had not been there many
minutes before the daughter of Forward went up with
them. She had hardly got there when Mr Ellis and
his daughter were startled by two rapid reports of a
pistol, and on the latter rushing up stairs she arrived
at the landing just in time to see Forward’s daughter
fall down dead, she having been shot by her father.
Miss Ellis then called out to her father, who came in,
and he saw Forward standing at the top of the stairs.
He said, “What have you done, Forward?” and
seeing that he had a pistol in his hand he called on him
to give it him, which he did. Forward at this time
had a black moustache and dark whiskers on. Ellis
then saw the feet of Forward’s wife, and on looking
over the table he saw her head, and that blood was
oozing therefrom. He told Forward to sit down, and
he then perceived that he had neither moustache nor
whiskers on. He asked Forward where they were, and
he replied that they were under the grate. He looked
there, but could not find them, and Forward then gave
them to him. He then called out to send for the police
and a surgeon. Forward added, “Yes; send for a
policeman.” He was then given into custody.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock at noon Forward was brought
before the magistrates, charged with the murder of his
wife and child.</p>

<p>Previous to the calling of any witnesses, the prisoner,
addressing the magistrates, said: I have here a paper
to Sir Richard Mayne, which I hope you will permit
me to read to you. I have a reason for it. If you
will grant me a favour, I think you will see that my
reason justifies me in asking it. Immediately I was
brought to the station-house I asked for some paper, a
pen, and some ink, that I might draw up this statement,
but it is not finished. I also made a statement to the
inspector in charge. I inquired whether he had heard
of the murder of three children in London. My reason
for asking this question was, that previous to my being
charged with this crime I was guilty of the murder of
the three children in London. I hope this may be
taken as a communication to Sir Richard Mayne, and
also that it is made quite voluntarily.</p>

<p>The evidence having been gone through, he was fully
committed to take his trial at the next Assizes for
wilful murder, when he was found guilty of the
murders, and was EXECUTED THIS MORNING
and died without a struggle.</p>

<h3><a name="EXECUTION_PIRATES" id="EXECUTION_PIRATES"></a>The Execution of Five Pirates, for Murder, which took place<br />
on Monday, February 22nd, at the Old Bailey.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This morning, Monday, February 22nd,
1864, will long be remembered by the inhabitants
of the city of London, as one of
the most remarkable in the annals of hanging,
by the execution of five foreign sailors,
viz.: John Lyons, Francisco Bianco, Mauriccio
Durranna, Marcus Watter, Miguel
Lopez, <i>alias</i> Joseph Chances, <i>alias</i> The
Catelan, for the wilful murder of George
Smith upon the high seas. The attendance
of persons to witness the execution was
enormous, being greater than was ever
remembered by the oldest inhabitant in the
City, and was much of the same class as
usually attend these exhibitions, with the
addition of a fair sprinkling of seafaring
men. The prisoners have been very assiduously
attended by the worthy Priests of the
Catholic persuasion, to which creed the
prisoners belong, and they had been brought
to a full knowledge of the enormity of the
crimes which they had committed; and to
such a state of religious feeling had they
been brought, that they all fully acknowledged
the share each one took in the horrible
crime, and recognized the justice of their
punishment. The sheriffs, with their usual
attendants, arrived at a very early hour at
the prison, and immediately visited the
various criminals in their cells. The worthy
priests who had been attending the criminals
since their condemnation, was in the prison
the whole night, and were early in their
attendance on the unhappy criminals. After
the usual formalities had been gone through
of demanding the bodies of the prisoners
into their custody, the executioner, with his
assistants, commenced pinioning the prisoners,
which operation was quickly performed,
considering the number of prisoners. The
arrangements having been completed, the
mournful procession began to move towards
the scaffold, the worthy priests praying
fervently with the wretched prisoners, who
appeared to have been fully brought to a
thorough state of penitence. The prisoners
ascended the scaffold in an orderly manner,
and directly they appeared on the drop, the
immense multitude gave a deep and loud
groan, which seemed to make some of the
wretched men tremble. The executioner
having adjusted the fatal ropes, and drawn
the caps over their eyes, left the platform,
and the priests administered the last parting
words of scriptural consolation to them.
The signal was then given, the bolts were
withdrawn, and the wretched murderers were
launched into eternity.</p>

For the Murder at Brighton.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Thursday, March 22nd, J. W. Leigh was indicted at the Lewes assizes for the wilful murder of Mrs. Harton,
at Brighton, on the 1st of February, 1866.</p>

<p>The first witness, Charles Hastings, deposed&mdash;On Thursday night, February 1st, I was in the bar parlour of the
Jolly Fisherman tavern with another person named Manuel, and Mrs. Harton, the landlady. She was sitting near
the fire, and furthest from the door. Prisoner came into the bar with a revolver in his hand, and as soon as Mrs.
Harton saw him she ran to witness for protection. While coming towards Witness prisoner fired the pistol at her
and shot her, the ball grazing the forehead of witness. Mrs. Harton fell on the shoulder of witness, and asked him
to save her. Prisoner followed her, and placing the revolver within two feet of the woman’s back fired again. Mrs.
Harton then left the bar and ran down into the cellar. Witness went for a doctor.</p>

<p>Stephen Loveday, a dyer, deposed he was in the bar, outside the bar-parlour, and saw the prisoner come. Prisoner
fired at Mrs. Harton, who ran down the cellar steps. Witness followed her, and found her lying half-way down the
stairs, groaning. He got her up stairs into the back room, where he left her.</p>

<p>Serjeant I. Barnden said&mdash;From information I received, I went to the Jolly Fisherman tavern about 11 o’clock on
the night of February 1st. I saw Mrs. Harton there wounded, and in a fainting state. I went out and saw the
prisoner standing in the street, leaning against a house near the King’s road end of Market street. Some one told
me not to go near the prisoner, or he would shoot me. I went towards the prisoner and said, “What’s all this
about?” He said, “Stand off, or I’ll shoot you,” at the same time bringing the pistol from his breast pocket. I said,
“Will you?” At that moment the pistol went off, and I closed with him. I must have touched his arm at the
precise instant, for the ball went through my overcoat and trousers, so that it just missed me. I threw him down,
and several people assisted me to take him to the Town Hall.</p>

<p>After the examination of several other witnesses, the prisoner’s counsel addressed the jury for the defence, and the
judge having summed up, the jury returned a verdict of Guilty. The judge passed the usual sentence of death upon
the prisoner, and he was executed this day in front of Lewes Gaol, before an immense crowd of spectators, who came
for many miles round.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A child murder has been committed at Park Horner, in the parish of Hampreston, under
circumstances of the most shocking barbarity. At the Coroner’s inquest it was given in
evidence that the child had been beaten on the head with a heavy flint stone, and its tongue
cut completely out at the root. It was found wrapped up in another part of a drawer where
the body was discovered. The inquiry lasted four hours and a-half, and resulted, in the first
instance, in a verdict, “That the child was born alive and murdered by someone.” The
Coroner pointed out that the evidence was conclusive against Emma Pitt, the national school-mistress,
who was the mother of the child; and he expressed his surprise that such a verdict
should have been returned. The Jury after reconsidering their previous finding, returned a
verdict of “Wilful murder against Emma Pitt.”</p>

<h3><a name="LAMENTATION_OF" id="LAMENTATION_OF"></a>LAMENTATION OF<br />
<span class="larger">J. MAPP,</span><br />
<i>Who now lies under Sentence of Death in Shrewsbury Gaol, for
the Murder of Catherine Lewis.</i></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Monday, March 23, at the Shrewsbury
Assizes, John Mapp, a labourer, was placed
at the bar, charged with the wilful murder of
Catherine Lewis, on the 22nd of December,
1867, at the parish of Longden.</p>

<p>Jane Richards deposed that after leaving
chapel she accompanied deceased and John
Mapp as far as Wood Farm, where she left
them together going down Long lane.</p>

<p>Edward Lewis, the father of the deceased,
deposed to Mrs. Hutchins bringing him his
daughter’s hat covered with blood. I at once
started in search through several fields till I
saw a hovel. There were marks at the door
as if something had been dragged along, and
on entering saw the body of my child in a
little bin, covered with straw and loose litter.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris, surgeon: I made a <i>post mortem</i>
examination of deceased. I found a shawl
tied round her neck, and about eight inches
shoved tightly into her mouth. There were
five incisions on the right side of the throat,
finishing in one deep wound on the left. The
windpipe was cut through. I attribute her
death to loss of blood and suffocation.</p>

<p>Edward Jones, police-constable, produced a
brooch belonging to deceased, which was found
on the prisoner when he took him into custody.</p>

<p>John Aston, a waggoner, deposed to finding
the hat of the deceased in a holly bush.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davies: I reside at Longden. I knew
the deceased. The brooch produced is the
one she wore.</p>

<p>The counsel for the prisoner then proceeded
to address the Jury for the defence, and the
counsel for the prosecution having replied,</p>

<p>The Judge then summed up, and the Jury
without retiring from the box returned a
verdict of Guilty. The usual Sentence of
Death was then pronounced upon the prisoner.</p>

<span class="larger">ALICE HOLT,</span><br />
In front of Chester Gaol, this day, for the Wicked Murder of her own Mother.</h3>

</div>

<p>This day the extreme sentence of the law was carried into effect on Alice Holt, at
Chester Gaol, for the murder of her mother by poison. The evidence at the trial
showed that prisoner, her mother, and a man named Holt, with whom she cohabited,
lived together at Stockport. In February last the deceased, Mary Bailey, was taken
ill, and the prisoner insured her life for £26, at a premium of 6d. per week. She
induced a woman named Betty Wood to personate her mother before the doctor, telling
her that the agent said “Any one would do.” The proposal was accepted by the
Wesleyan Assurance Society, and from that time the mother became worse. Prisoner
called in the parish surgeon and the infirmary visiting officer, both of whom were
ignorant of the other’s visits, and complained of their medicine not being given. On
the 25th and 26th the prisoner bought some arsenic&mdash;a quarter of a pound each time&mdash;which
she put in a jug with some boiling water, and sprinkled about the room
where her mother lay to kill vermin. The night of the 26th deceased had some
brandy-and-water, and complained of “grounds” being at the bottom. Prisoner said,
“You ought to have drunk grounds and all.” Mary Bailey died in the morning with
all the symptoms of arsenical poison, and was buried. The personation came to the
ears of the office, and the body was disinterred, when it was found perfectly fresh, but
“saturated with arsenic,” of which no less than 160 grains were found in the stomach
and adjacent parts.</p>

<p>The unfortunate woman was not tried at the Summer Assizes, in consequence of her
being in the family-way. The child has since been adopted by Holt’s uncle, the only
person who has visited her since during her imprisonment. She has been sullen, and
strongly protested her innocence.</p>

<h4>CONFESSION.</h4>

<p>On Sunday, the prisoner made the following statement:&mdash;On the Monday before
mother died, I brought the insurance paper home, insuring my mother’s life for £26,
and mine for £28. He then proposed I should get some charcoal and put it under
mother’s bed alight, when she was asleep, and she would never wake more. On
Wednesday night Holt and I never went to bed. He said it would be a great releasement
if she was in her grave, and he would buy some stretchnine (strychnine) if I
would give it her. I said, “Thou’lt be found out.” He said, “They cannot find it
out by that.” I said, “Thou hast brought me to destruction, and now thou wants to
bring me to the gallows.” He then beat me. In the beer of which I spoke, I saw, after my mother had drank it,
a quantity of blue arsenic grounds. I said, “Thou hast given my mother arsenic.” He said, “If thou tell aught,
I will have thee up for defrauding the insurance,” and said, “Nobody will believe but what thou hast done it
thyself.” This was the only arsenic my mother ever had.&mdash;Another statement was afterwards made by the prisoner.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION</h4>

<p>Took place this morning. When near the drop her courage failed her, and she was half dragged, half
carried to the scaffold. On the platform she fell on her knees, and moaned piteously, “The Lord have mercy
upon me,” which she continued to do whilst Calcraft pulled the bolt. The drop fell, and the culprit was launched
into eternity before a great many people, particularly women-folks.</p>

<h3><a name="CRUEL_AND_INHUMAN_MURDER" id="CRUEL_AND_INHUMAN_MURDER"></a><span class="larger">CRUEL AND INHUMAN MURDER</span><br />
<i>Of a little Boy, by his Father</i>.<br />
COMMITTAL OF THE PRISONER.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Monday morning a cruel and inhuman
murder was committed by the father on a
child aged six years, in Neal’s passage, Seven
Dials. The father has been separated from
his wife for some time, and the boy had been
brought up by its maternal grandmother, a
poor old woman. The child being an
unusally intelligent and nice-looking boy
was a great favourite with the grandmother
and an aunt who lived in the same room.
It appears the mother had been living with
another man as his wife, and the father also
had formed an illicit connection with another
woman. The poor boy had consequently
become a source of trouble to both of them,
although the merest trifle was required for
its maintenance.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening the father (Jeffery)
called at the grandmother’s for the boy.
She asked him what he wanted with the
child, but he became very violent, ordered
the child to dress himself, and swore that
“he would do for her and the child too,” if
she did not mind. Jeffrey then went to his
sister, in White Lion street, taking the child
with him, and asked for a bed. He was
accommodated with one, and went to bed
with the boy; but at two o’clock in the
morning he rose, and took the child away.
He could not have walked many yards away&mdash;for
Neal’s passage, where the body of the
deceased was found, is close at hand. The
child was found suspended from a projecting
beam or bracket in a cellar to which all the
residents had access for water, &amp;c. Horrible
as it seems, it is apparent from the condition
of the body, that the cruel father tied its
hands behind, and had literally enacted the
part of executioner of his own child, holding
its legs, and forcing down its body to complete
the strangulation of the poor boy.
The child remained in this position till about
half-past six o’clock, when it was seen by a
girl who had occasion to go to the cellar,
and who gave the alarm. Dr. Harvey, the
parish surgeon, attended directly, and pronounced
the child to have been dead about
three or four hours.</p>

<p>Dr. Lankester, the coroner, held an
adjourned inquest on Wednesday, and there
being no further evidence the jury returned
a verdict of wilful murder by hanging and
suffocation of Richard A. Jefferey, by his
father, John R. Jefferey. The prisoner was
examined at Bow street yesterday, and committed
to Newgate.</p>

<h3><a name="MURDER_OF_A_WIFE" id="MURDER_OF_A_WIFE"></a><span class="larger">MURDER OF A WIFE</span><br />
AT ASHBURNHAM, NEAR HASTINGS.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A shocking murder of a wife was committed
on Sunday, at Ashburnham, a village
near Hastings. Near the village is a
quantity of land called Gardener’s Farm,
which is farmed by an old man named
Stubberfield and his son Jeremiah. The son,
who is married, has a separate residence
about sixty yards from that of his parent.
There were living in the same house with
the son, his wife Matilda, their son, Mary
Deeprose (a companion to Mrs Stubberfield),
and several farm labourers and servants.
The boy, eight years old, who occupied the
same room with his parents, states that early
on Sunday morning he saw his father
kneeling upon his mother, and squeezing her
throat. Hearing his mother say, “Oh!”
feebly, as is in pain, he said to his father,
“Your hurting mother.” “You hold your
tongue,” replied the father, “I’m only
tickling her.” The boy again made a
similar remark, upon which the father
said that if he didn’t hold his tongue he
would “see to him.” Stubberfield then
dressed himself, and having kissed his wife
and child, went down stairs. The boy
immediately aroused the other inmates of
the house, who were soon in the bedroom of
the murdered woman. The police were sent
for, and in a short time, some two hundred
persons were scouring the neighbourhood in
search of Stubberfield, and it was not till
the afternoon he was discovered, and then
he was making his way towards home. He
had secreted himself in a pit, and tried to
drown himself, but could not do so, for he
always floated on the top of the water.</p>

<p>This morning the unfortunate Fenian convict, Michael Barrett, suffered the extreme penalty of the law at the Old
Bailey. The prisoner has been attended by the Rev. Mr. Hussey, a Roman Catholic priest, who has remained with
him a considerable time every day. He was very taciturn, and although he was no doubt aware of the efforts that
were being made to obtain a reprieve, it was a noticeable fact that he never attempted to declare his innocence.
Down to recently he used to attend the service in the prison regularly, but after Mr. Hussey had been with him he
entirely refrained from doing so. He has not been visited by any one since his conviction. All his relations appear
to reside in Ireland, and he does not seem to have had any connexions or friends in this country.</p>

<p>The sheriffs of the prison arrived at an early hour, and immediately proceeded to the condemned cell, where they
found the prisoner in devotional exercises with the Rev. Mr. Hussey. He declared himself ready to die, and seemed
to consider himself a martyr. The time having arrived, Calcraft, the executioner, was introduced to the prisoner,
who immediately commenced pinioning him, which operation having been gone through, the prisoner thanked the
governor and other officials of the prison for their kindness towards him. The procession was then formed, and
slowly took its way towards the scene of execution. The prisoner ascended the scaffold with a firm step. Everything
having been prepared, the cap was drawn over his eyes and the rope adjusted, the bolt was drawn, and he appeared
to struggle but slightly before life was extinct.</p>

<p>This morning, Saturday, November 23rd, the three
unfortunate convicts, Gould, Allen, and Larkin, suffered
the extreme penalty of the law at the New Bailey
prison, Manchester. Since their condemnation the culprits
have behaved in a most exemplary manner, and
have paid great attention to the Rev. gentlemen who
attended them. They continued to declare their innocence
to the last, and appeared to think themselves
martyrs to a grand cause, and appeared quite ready for
the event. The mob was very great, but not so large
as it might have been, but for the precautions taken by
the authorities, who had erected barricades about every
thirty yards, and so prevented the great pressure that
would have been. The prisoners were astir at an early
hour, and partook of the holy communion, and at the
appointed time. Calcraft, the executioner, was introduced,
when the operation of pinioning was gone
through. The prisoners the meanwhile showed wonderful
confidence, and appeared to be the least concerned.
They all shook hands together and affectionately
embraced one another, and declared themselves ready.
The mournful procession was then formed, and at once
proceeded towards the scaffold, where on their appearance
there was a slight manifestation of applause.
Everything having been prepared, the ropes adjusted,
the signal was given, and the unhappy men were
launched into eternity. The prisoners appeared to die
very easy.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, April 20, the last dread sentence of the
law was carried out in the case of Wm. Sheward convicted
at the last Norwich Assizes for the murder of
his wife. The culprit died without any very painful
struggles. He showed a considerable amount ef nerve,
although he trembled a good deal at the drop, to which
he had to be carried on account of his rheumatism. In
the prisoner’s confession he stated that he killed his
wife in June, 1851, and that he afterwards mutilated
the body. He placed the head in a saucepan, and put
it on the fire to keep the stench away. He then broke
it up, and distributed it about Thorpe. He then put
the hands and feet in the same saucepan, in hopes they
might boil away. Carried portions of the body away
in a pail and threw them in different parts of the city.
The long hair on my return from Thorpe, he cut with a
pair of scissors in small pieces and they blew away as
he walked. The blankets, where there was any blood
he cut in small pieces, and distributed them about the
city, and made off with anything that had the appearance
of blood about them. The prisoner also stated
that he never saw or knew his present wife until June
21, 1852, twelve months after the occurrence.&mdash;The
confession was taken in the presence of a magistrate,
and the governor and chaplain.</p>

<span class="larger">JOHN DEVINE,</span><br />
In front of Newgate, for the Murder of JOSEPH DUCK,

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/img282.jpg" width="150" height="177" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On Monday morning,
at Eight o’clock, John
Devine suffered the extreme
penalty of the
law, in front of Newgate.
Not so much excitement
was created
as we have noticed on
similar occasions, although
a very large
concourse of persons
had assembled to witness the shocking
spectacle. In fact, we might say every
available spot was occupied by both male and
female, all of whom were anxious to get a
“good place,” to see the wretched culprit on
the drop. Precisely at the appointed time
the sheriffs, with their usual attendants,
arrived at the prison, and, after the necessary
ceremonies had been observed, of demanding
the body of the prisoner to be delivered into
their custody, they were conducted to the
waiting room. The executioner then commenced
pinioning the arms, which operation
he quickly dispatched. During the awful
preparations the unhappy prisoner appeared
to feel his sad position deeply.</p>

<p>At length the arrangements having been
completed, the bell of the prison commenced
tolling and the chaplain read in a distinct
tone the burial service for the dead. When
the bell commenced tolling, a movement
was heard from without, and the words
“Hats off” and “Silence” were distinctly
heard, from which time no sound, excepting
the sighs of the unhappy prisoner, interrupted
the chaplain as the procession moved along
the subterranean passage. The prisoner, on
arriving at the scaffold, hastily glanced around
at the immense concourse of persons assembled.
After which he was placed in the
proper position for Calcraft to adjust the
ropes. The executioner having drawn the
cap over his face retired from the scaffold,
and the signal having been given the bolt
was withdrawn, and the unhappy criminal
was launched into eternity.</p>

<h4>CONFESSION OF THE CULPRIT.</h4>

<p>On Thursday the unhappy criminal was
visited by the worthy chaplain, to whom he
made a confession, and fully admitted the
justice of his sentence.</p>

<h3><a name="EXECUTION_BROWN" id="EXECUTION_BROWN"></a>LIFE, TRIAL, CONFESSION, AND EXECUTION OF<br />
<span class="largest">MARTIN BROWN,</span><br />
FOR THE DIABOLICAL MURDER ON NEWMARKET HILL NEAR,<br />
LEWES.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The facts of this deliberate and cruel murder must be
fresh in the minds of all persons. The deceased was a
labourer (in the employ of Mr Hodson, farmer, at
Kingston, near Lewes), and lived in a cottage on Newmarket
Hill, about a mile and a half from the village.
Martin Brown worked for the same employer, and
lodged with the deceased and his family, and left about
six weeks before the murder, but continued in the same
service, lodging with the farm bailiff, named Wickham.
The deceased was paid fortnightly, and on the 9th of
October he left home for Kingston, to receive the wages
of himself and two sons, boys; and he was paid £2 11s.
He was also paid 24s. by another son at Kingston, and
he had 5s. 3d. in his tobacco-box when he left home, at
half-past six o’clock in the evening. He never returned;
and early the next morning he was found dead on the
hill, about a quarter of a mile from his home. His
pockets were then empty. It was discovered that he
had been shot through the back&mdash;three small bullets
were taken from the body&mdash;and that he had been
severely beaten about the head with some heavy instrument,
but after death had taken place. The trigger of
a gun and a small piece of gun-stock were found close
to the body, and in a copse not far from the spot there
was subsequently found a broken gun-stock, to which
the pieces found close to the body accurately fitted.
This gun-stock belonged to a gun which the prisoner
had purchased three weeks before the murder; and
which he took out on the night of the murder, stating
that he was going to take it to his brother at Brighton,
and should not be back till the next day. He returned,
however, the same evening, and in less time than it was
possible for him to go to Brighton and get back again;
and on the following evening,&mdash;the murder was freely
talked of, and prisoner was even suspected,&mdash;he absconded.</p>

<p>He was apprehended by Mr Superintendent Crowhurst,
at Maidstone, where he had enlisted under the
name of Reuben Harvey.</p>

<p>He was tried at the Sussex Winter Assizes, found
guilty, and sentenced to death.</p>

<h4>THE EXECUTION.</h4>

<p>The execution took place this morning, at eight
o’clock, It was the first execution at Lewes since the
passing of the recent act of Parliament; which is carried
out in private, within the prison walls. Shortly
before eight o’clock, the black flag was hoisted, and the
prison-bell began to toll. All the arrangements being
completed, Calcraft began the process of pinioning the
condemned man, who appeared to be quite calm. At
eight o’clock, the mournful and melancholy procession
began to move towards the gallows; the culprit walked
slowly, but firm, and having arrived at the foot of the
gallows, he mounted the steps on to the top of the
platform, and placed himself on the trap-door, under
the fatal beam; Calcraft then put over his head the cap,
and placing the rope round his neck, he then shook
hands with him, and instantly the bolt was withdrawn,
and the unhappy man was launched into eternity.
After a few short struggles, life was extinct. After
hanging an hour, the body was cut down, and buried
within the precincts of the prison.</p>

For the Wilful Murder of Mrs. Grossmith.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img259.jpg" width="250" height="297" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This morning the unfortunate convict, Alexander
Mackay, suffered the extreme penalty of the law at
Newgate, for the murder of Mrs. Grossmith, at Norton
Folgate.</p>

<p>This is the second execution that has been carried
out in private, under the provisions of the recent statute,
and it, of course, necessitated the making of a great
many alterations with regard to the details. It was at
first proposed that the scaffold should be erected in one
of the yards adjoining the scaffold, upon the level; but,
although the original plan was adhered to, it was decided
that the scaffold should not be on a level, and the
culprit, as was the case before, had to reach the drop by
ascending a ladder.</p>

<p>It is due to the prisoner to state that he seems to
have conducted himself very well since his condemnation,
and as far as outward appearance can be relied
upon, he seems to have felt severe remorse for his crime.
He was visited last week by his father, his brother-in-law,
and two sisters, and these interviews, as may be
readily imagined, were of a most painful character.</p>

<p>The sheriffs of the prison having arrived, immediately
proceeded to the condemned cell. The executioner was
shortly afterwards introduced to the prisoner, who immediately
commenced pinioning him. During this very
trying operation, the wretched criminal only once he
exclaimed, “May the Lord have mercy on my soul!”
Everything having been completed, the prisoner thanked
the chaplain and officers of the prison for their kindness
towards him. The procession was formed, and slowly
took its way towards the scaffold, which the prisoner
ascended with a firm step; the rope was then speedily
adjusted, the bolt was drawn, and the wretched man
after a few struggles ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The bell of St. Sepulchre tolled as the prisoner left
his cell; and immediately on the drop falling a black
flag was raised, announcing that the last dread sentence
of the law had been carried into effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Monday morning last, a terrible tragedy took place in Hosier-lane, City, in which a
man named Duggin, his wife, and six children were found poisoned. On Saturday evening
Duggin returned from his work, and he then looked rather sad, and his wife told a female
neighbour that her husband had been dismissed his employment, and they had also received
notice to leave their lodgings at 12 o’clock on Monday. On Sunday evening Duggin took
his wife and children out for a walk, and on his return went to the Wheatsheaf-tavern,
Hosier-lane, and asked the landlord for a quart of ale. He then left, and was not seen again
until half-past 4. o’clock on Monday morning, when a man saw him drop a letter in the
Hospital pillar letter-box, and then walked towards his home. Two hours afterwards the
police received a letter signed James Duggin, stating that he had murdered seven persons,
and that he was about to destroy his own life. In it he said the police would be able to obtain
further particulars of his brother at Sheffield. Constables were immediately despatched to
15, Hosier-lane, where they found the writer of the letter lying dead upon a bed in a room
by himself. In another room they found lying on a bed, a boy aged 4, and a girl aged 3,
lying upon the arms of the dead body of the mother. At the foot of the bed was the dead
body of a girl aged 12, and on another bed lay the dead body of another child.</p>

</div>

<p>This morning Frederick Hinson suffered the extreme penalty of the law at the Old Bailey, for the murder of Maria Death.</p>

<p>The prisoner previous to his trial behaved in a most sullen manner, scarcely heeding anything that was said to him. It is satisfactory
to state that since his condemnation the conduct of the unhappy man underwent a total change for the better, and he began to realize the
awful condition in which he was placed, and his callous demeanour was changed into one of deep dejection. The prisoner has been
assiduously attended by the chaplain of the prison, and to such a state of religious feeling had he been brought, that he fully acknowledged
the justice of his sentence. He has frequently alluded to his great affection for the unfortunate woman, and his regret at having sent her
before her maker totally unprepared. Since his condemnation, the prisoner has been visited by his children, and also his father, the final
parting from whom was of the most affecting character, and will not be forgotten by those who witnessed it.</p>

<p>The sheriffs arrived at an early hour, and immediately proceeded to the condemned cell, where they found the prisoner earnestly engaged
in his religious duties with the chaplain of the prison. The time had now arrived for the prisoner to be pinioned, the operation of which
was quickly performed, and the wretched man having thanked the chaplain, the governor, and other officials for their kindness towards him,
the procession was then formed, and slowly took its way to the scene of execution. The cap and rope having been adjusted, the bolt was
drawn, and the wretched man ceased to exist. Simultaneously with the drop falling, a black flag was hoisted at one corner of the prison,
announcing that the last dread sentence of the law had been carried into effect.</p>

At Bury St. Edmunds, for the MURDER<br />
of J. HIGHT.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img288.jpg" width="500" height="381" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This morning, at the county prison, Bury St. Edmunds, James Rutterford underwent the last dread sentence of
the law, for the wilful and deliberate murder of John Hight, a gamekeeper, in the employ of Maharajah Dhuleep
Singh, at Eriswell, Suffolk, on the 31st of December last. The prisoner, since his condemnation, has displayed a
perfect indifference as to his awful situation, and when spoken to about the murder, always tried to avoid it. He has
been constantly attended by the worthy chaplain, and has paid particular attention to what he said, but in a quiet
surly mood. The prisoner was visited last week by a government inspector, for the purpose of examining the neck
of the prisoner, the gaol surgeon having reported that he had a malformation, which might cause an unusual degree
of suffering on death being inflicted by strangulation. The inspector came to the conclusion that there was nothing
in the neck of the convict to prevent his being hanged in the usual manner.</p>

<p>The sheriffs arrived at an early hour, and immediately proceeded to the condemned cell, where they found the
prisoner earnestly engaged in his religious duties, with the worthy chaplain of the prison. The time had now
arrived for the prisoner to be pinioned, the operation of which was quickly performed, and the wretched man thanked
the parson, the governor, and other officials for their kindness towards him. The procession was formed, and slowly
took its way to the scene of execution. The cap and rope having been adjusted, the bolt was drawn, and the
wretched man soon ceased to exist. Simultaneously with the drop falling, a black flag was hoisted at one corner of
the prison, announcing that the last dread sentence of the law had been carried into effect.</p>

<h4>THE HEROES OF THE GALLOWS AND GUILLOTINE.</h4>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="center">“One murder makes a villain, a million a hero.”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The above words of our illustrious bard may well be re-applied to the professional manipulators of the
gallows and the guillotine, in England and France. In both countries, said to be the head of European civilization,
the executioner seems to be a beloved and venerated object, and regarded as a hero worthy of the support of
majesty and power, while smaller and less pretending kingdoms around are, one by one, abolishing his hideous
and useless office.</p>

<p>It is a most striking and instructive anomaly, and worthy of the statesman, the philanthropist, the Christian,
and all who wish for the moral progress of society, to consider and seriously examine the seeds of evil it is
sowing broadcast among the human family. France is a huge nation of contradictions, never to be thoroughly
understood, and England is now, in a threefold sense, her sister! Every since their first sanguinary revolution
some classes of the French people have <i>fondly hugged</i> the guillotine as a national toy of great worth, and petted
three generations of <span class="smcap">Sansons</span> as their most excellent scientific headsmen; they have also at every execution
followed the criminal sitting in a cart, bound and bare-necked, on his coffin, beside his confessor, and gloated with
open mouths and staring eyeballs upon the descending blade and the head rolling into the basket of sawdust; and
have dipped their handkerchiefs in the bloodsplashes that appeared to fall beyond the bounds of the gibbet. Other
classes, of which judges and juries are made, have tried murderers of the most demoniac nature, and to the
amazement of the whole woard, by the fiction of “extenuating circumstances” appended to their verdicts, have
saved them from capital punishment and consigned them to the galleys; in violation of their own consciences and
oaths and the law, which sustains the guillotine as an engine of terror and example!</p>

<p>In our own country within the last few months we have witnessed the passing of a law abolishing public
executions, on account of the demoralization that always attended their exhibition in the public highway, and
which was complained of for many years by the virtuous and good of every class, who could discern the evils they
generated and their inefficiency for either terror or example!</p>

<p>But oh! most singular inconsistency, with the passing of that law, and the substitution of private strangling
within the prison-yard, the last tatters of the old worn-out argument in favour of executions as a terror to evil-doers
and an example to embryo-offenders, are completely torn away, and yet England at this time nurses three
rival hangmen in her official lap for performing her secret hanging business! The three worthies are <span class="smcap">Askern</span>,
of York Castle, <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, of Stafford-gaol, and <span class="smcap">Calcraft</span>, of Newgate, in London. Three heroes of the gallows&mdash;three
professional stranglers&mdash;yes, “three servants of the law,” England can now boast of, against France’s single
hero of the guillotine to hang up their fellow sinners for a terror and an example! Let us now enquire of the
advocates of death punishments how secret executions can terrify or afford an example in the eyes of those they
are intended to influence, when they are permitted no longer to witness them?</p>

<p>It needs not a waste of words to prove clearly, that what was before a barbarous and demoralising exhibition,
and an inefficient preventative of crime, is now a useless operation and a ghastly tragedy for sickening and torturing
all those whom the law compels or the authorities permit to be personal spectators. As the daily and
weekly papers published since Calcraft’s and Smith’s joint essays with the first private strangling machine at
Maidstone, have proved, murders and other sanguinary offences tending to the same end, do not in the least
decrease; but on contrary, the graphic accounts of the first private execution, and the form and action of the new
method that were afterwards given in every morning and evening journal, served only to <i>entertain</i> and amuse the
lovers of horrors, and were followed by a repetition of capital crimes in several places, as if no such punishment
awaited the perpetrators of them. And so will it be after the second trial of the new system, on the boy <span class="smcap">Mackay</span>,
at Newgate, for the Norton Forgate murder, until society to its lowest depths is more moralised and humanised;
and a more exacting retribution is enforced against the hardened classes, whom no law of capital punishment will
now terrify into submission.</p>

<p>As the Star’s special reporter’s description is worth preserving in its entirety, both for what it says, and for
<i>what it does not say</i>. in favour of our argument, <i>at its conclusion</i>, we shall transcribe it into this part of our book:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The first execution within the prison walls, and in presence only of a limited number of spectators, in accordanoe with the
new Act of Parliament for the better regulation of capital punishment, took place on Tuesday morning, August 13th, at Maidstone
Gaol. The culprit who suffered sentence was Thomas Wells, late a porter in the employ of the London, Chatham, and Dover
Railway Company, who was left for death after the last assizes for the murder of Mr. Walsh, the station-master at Dover. In the
course of his duties Mr. Walsh had occasion to find fault with Wells, who took reproof in very ill part, and revenged himself on
the first available opportunity on the unfortunate station-master by shooting him dead as he sat alone at his work in his office.
The alarm was raised, and Wells was found hiding close at hand. The proofs of his crime were so positive that he scarcely
attempted to deny it, and on his trial he was at once found guilty and condemned to death. The reports which from time to time
have appeared in the public prints since his condemnation have described the young man&mdash;he was little more than eighteen years
of age&mdash;as sincerely penitent, and these reports are borne out by the prison officers, who seemed to have been much impressed by
his quiet and decorous conduct.</p>

<p>The curious in such matters will note as an odd coincidence the fact that Maidstone&mdash;a town so notorious for its anti-capital
punishment feeling, that lawyers will tell you it is most difficult to get a jury to return an adverse verdict against a prisoner on trial
for his life&mdash;should have been the first place in which the arrangements of the death sentence under the new law should have
been carried out. Whether in pursuance of this feeling the inhabitants wilfully ignored the tragedy which was about to be enacted
in the immediate outskirts of their town, or whether they were indifferent to it, or whether the exact period of the execution has
been hidden from them, it is impossible to say; but it is certain that, amongst the people freely scattered about the broad and
handsome streets on Wednesday evening, there was not the slightest indication that anything unusual was to take place among them
the following day. A travelling menagerie, which had pitched its tent close by the borders of the canal, was thronged with
delighted gazers, among whom the private-soldier element was strongly represented. The local volunteers, headed by their band,
were attended in their march by many of the youthful population, and a still larger gathering followed the band of the militia
regiment, and grouped round them as they played in front of their headquarters, the Mitre Hotel. But in none of the crowds,
composed as they were of townspeople&mdash;old and young, male and female&mdash;did one hear the best allusion, either in earnestness or
ribaldry, to the criminal who was spending his last hours within a few hundred yards of the place where this gaity was beingcarried
on, and to whose ears, deafen them how he might, abstract his senses how he would, the clangour of the drums must have been
painfully audible. Nor was there any remarkable difference yesterday morning. It had been expected that a large majority of
the shops would remain closed until after the execution, which was fixed to take place at half-past ten, but the shutters were
taken down at the usual hour, men proceeded to their usual avocations, and there was not the smallest sign&mdash;not even that most
ordinary sign of men and women conversing in knots and groups&mdash;of anything unusual being about to happen, until one reached
the immediate neighbourhood of the gaol, and there, on the far side of the broad road running round by the court-house, was a
thin fringe of humanity, some fifty persons in all, in one long line, looking towards the great gate of the gaol, and talking among
themselves. Emphatically a “bad lot” this, tramps out on hopping excursions, beggars, a female gipsy or two&mdash;men and
women, too, the lowest scum of the population, and a dozen eager-eyed, wolfish, cunning-looking blackguard boys. They gape
and stare, though there is nothing for them to look at as yet; the gaol-gate is closed, and there is no one in the immediate neighbourhood,
so they take stock of the flagstaff, on which, in accordance with official injunctions, the “black flag” is to be run up
at the moment of the execution, and find matter for comment in the exit from the gaol of certain stonemasons who have been at
work inside the prison walls.</p>

<p>At half-past nine exactly a four-wheeled cab drives rapidly up the street, and pulls up at the door of the New Inn, immediately
opposite the Court house. The cab door and the inn door open simultaneously; from the former descends a man, who
inters the inn, the door of which is again immediately closed upon him, while the cab drives off. In two minutes this man
emerges from the inn and makes for the gaol. He is an elderly man, with white hair and white beard, broad and thick-set, and
dressed in black, with a peculiar tall hat, and carries a small carpet bag in his hand. This is Calcraft, the hangman. As it
were intuitively the little crowd becomes aware of this, a whisper runs round among it that the bag contains his “tackle” of
pinioning straps, &amp;c., and the blackguard boys, excited beyond bearing, spring to their feet and start in pursuit. The man, taking
no notice and looking doggedly before him, crosses the road, and getting close to the gaol railings, half slinks, half shambles
along till he reaches the gate which opens at his approach and closes behind him. Five minutes afterwards another man issues
from the inn and makes for the gaol&mdash;a tall, thin, wiry man, with a keen eye, with his cheeks and part of his forehead closely
shaved, dressed in a velveteen shooting coat, loose trousers, and billycock hat, and looking like an acrobat who had donned his
private clothes over his professional costume. The little crowd does not know this man, though he is almost as notorious as the
other. He is Smith, of Dudley, the hangman of the Birmingham district, who hanged Palmer, and who occasionally assists
Calcraft on great occasions.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the representatives of the press, who have been provided by the authorities with proper credentials, are
admitted into the prison, and are first ushered into the round-house, a building in the debtors’ division, where the turnkeys on
duty pass the night. It is fitted with a desk and benches, is glazed on all sides, and overlooks the front court and several of the
exercise yards. Several of the warders are here, and from them one learns that the prisoner passed a quiet night, sleeping from
half-past ten till half-past four, but that the extraordinary equanimity which he had hitherto displayed is failing him now, and
that he is beginning to “break down.” This conversation is carried on in a low whisper; the silence of the place is singularly
oppressive; and this, combined with the knowledge of what one is about immediately to witness, renders this period one of the
most painful suspense. There are five hundred prisoners within the gaol, but one might as well be in the City of the Dead for
all one hears of them, the only sound, the jingling of the warders’ keys, grating on the ear. A little excitement is caused by the
hurried entrance of a warder from the direction in which the prisoner is known to be, and his equally hurried disappearance
bearing some brandy in a tumbler, but the silence sets in afresh, and one is reduced to watching two little knots in the fore court.
One of these consists of the under-sheriff (who is deeply affected), the medical officer, and a <i>nonchalant</i> person in a wideawake
hat, who is said to be the governor, but who takes no part in the proceedings, and who is poking up the ground with his walking-stick
in a very <i>degagé</i> manner. The other knot is formed of Calcraft, his assistant, and two of the warders who are chatting
together. At twenty-five minutes past ten the party&mdash;consisting of four reporters of the London journals, six from various local
papers, a carpenter who is in attendance lest his service should be required in connection with the arrangements of the drop, and
a warder in plain clothes who has been sitting up all night with the prisoner&mdash;is summoned from the round-house and ushered
into a narrow vaulted ante-room, whence, after five minutes’ delay, they are led through a narrow passage into the presence of
the gallows.</p>

<p>There it stands, erected under a shed at the further end of a small yard some thirty feet square, the old square gallows formed
of two uprights and one crosebeam, and whose form has been familiar to us from woodcuts and description for years, only in this
instance it is painted buff instead of the ordinary dead black. The uprights across have iron supports fixed into the wall, and in
the crossbeam there is a hook, immediate under which stands Thomas Wells, with the rope round his neck. There is no built
scaffold; the drop on which the prisoner stands is flush with the ground, and the public (if the little representative party can be
so called) is placed behind a barrier breast-high, yet so close to the prisoner that they can see every movement of his face, and
hear every word he utters. He looks a mere youth, short, yet strongly built. He is dressed in his railway porter’s uniform of
velveteen, with the company’s initials in red on the collar, and in his waistcoat, just above his pinioned hand, wears a small
flower. He evidently knows little of anything of what is going on around him. He is absorbed in prayer&mdash;his face, of a livid
hue, is upturned, and his eyes are looking upwards. Standing by him, the chaplain, the Rev. W. C. F. Sugden Frazer, reads, in a
voice broken with emotion, the burial service. Suddenly the prisoner begins, in a low, thick, trembling voice, to sing a hymn&mdash;one,
as we afterwards learn, which he has been recently repeating in his cell&mdash;and continues to sing it after Calcraft has pulled
the cap over his face, and the chaplain has shaken hands with him&mdash;is singing it when, at a signal from his superior, Smith pulls
the bolt, and then, with a sickening rattle, the drop falls, Calcraft standing behind, and, as it were, guiding the falling figure. In
our belief, life was not wholly extinct for three or four minutes after the falling of the drop. It is usual on these occasions to
speak of the movements of the limbs as being “merely muscular,” in this instance there was scarcely any muscular contortion,
but there were undoubtedly deep respirations and other undeniable evidence that asphyxia did not immediately happen.</p>

<p>Such is the history of the first private execution in England. Anticipated with just horror by those who were compelled to
be present, it was carried out with every decency and all decorum, in a manner calculated to give the least pain to those whose
duty it was to witness it. The presence of the representatives of the press at a private execution is a guarantee to the public,
whose delegates they are, that the sentence of the law which has been passed upon a certain criminal is duly carried out. But
there is no occasion to inflict upon them, as was the case at Newgate, the horror of witnessing the pinioning, the procession, and
all the awful details of the scaffold. These, thanks to the visiting justices and to the under-sheriff of Kent, Mr. Furley, of
Ashford, were spared at Maidstone, and will, it is to be hoped, be spared in future. Meanwhile, so far as this one instance
affords means of judging, <span class="smcap">IS THE EXECUTION UNDER THE NEW LAW MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN UNDER THE OLD</span>? We answer,
decidedly, in the affirmative. The applause or censure of the mob, the desire to “die game” before his friends, had, it is acknowledged,
the worst influence on the prisoner, and the solemn stillness of the little yard, with its handful of spectators, <i>must have
been</i> <span class="smcap">IMPRESSIVE</span> <i>in the most awful degree</i>, while a peaceful provincial town is left to its usual avocations, entirely free from the
influx of pestilent blackguardism, drunkenness, and obscenity which always attended a public hanging.</p></div>

<p>For the moral purpose of our theme, there are but <i>three items</i> worth noticing in the above account; they are
1st.&mdash;The <i>black flag</i>, hoisted as a terror and example to the “bad lot” of “tramps out on hopping excursion,
beggars, a female gipsy or two, men and women, the lowest scum of the population, and a dozen eager-eyed,
wolfish, cunning-looking boys!” 2nd.&mdash;The officials and representatives of the press who “<i>anticipated with just</i>
<span class="smcap">HORROR</span>” the coming scene at which they “<i>were compelled to be present</i>, and then when it is enacted as the primary
<span class="smcap">National Play</span> for the time being, <i>staring</i> at the prisoner in his “railway porter’s uniform of velveteen,” roped
to the fatal beam, with a faded flower “in his waistcoat, just above his pinioned hands,” absorbed in prayer&mdash;his
face of a livid hue, upturned, and his eyes looking upwards; at the same time singing a hymn “in a low, thick,
trembling voice,” “after Calcraft has pulled the cap over his face,” and the Chaplain, who had been reading “in
a voice broken with emotion, the burial service,” “has shaken hands with him;” and then <i>listening</i> to the “<span class="smcap">SICKENING
RATTLE</span>” in the criminal’s throat, mixed with the whirring sound of the collapsing machinery, as “Smith
pulls the bolt,” and “the drop falls,” while “Calcraft is standing behind, and, as it were, guiding the falling
figure” into the newly-dug pit below; and 3rd&mdash;the summing-up question and answer of the reporter, after
making one of a group at this disgusting performance. “Is the execution under the new law more <i>impressive</i>
than under the old?” “We answer decidedly in the affirmative. The applause or censure of the mob, the desire
to ‘die game’ before his friends, had, it is acknowledged, the worst influence on the prisoner, and the solemn
stillness of the little yard, with its handful of spectators, <i>must have been impressive</i> in the most awful degree.”</p>

<p>Impressive upon whom let us here ask? Not upon the “bad lot” contemplating the black flag! The very
class who needed some wholesome impression of fear, and who never realised it at public hangings, were shut out
and left to indulge their idle fancies and curious promptings&mdash;a kind of pleasure to them! If it were impressive
upon the “gentlemen of England,” and the representatives of the press, while looking upon a drama so horrible,
we should imagine that it was in a sense different from that for which capital punishments were enacted; unless
we were to believe that, notwithstanding their high refinement, they were susceptible of murderous emotions.</p>

<p>Then there remains only what the conclusion of the report seems to point at, that it was impressive upon
the dying criminal, thus leaving only one poor miserable pretence for sustaining the existence of the gallows as a
moral preventative, and a wholesome example. Of what use to society is the transitory impression of an agonised
wretch about to die unobserved by the world? None whatever, and therefore the advocates of death punishments
must soon give way to those of our opinion, that the gallows is an effete institution, unfit for its purpose;
and that solitary confinement and hard labour for life would not only be a greater and more deterring punishment,
but a security against prematurely hurrying into eternity, as in days of old, <i>innocent</i> persons, wrongly
convicted through some vile perjury of the wicked, mistaken identity, or imperfectly unravelled circumstances.</p>

<p>Amongst the earliest converts, we expect soon to number the reporter of the above quoted narrative, and most
of his literary brethren. For promoting the cause of abolition, we have issued this pamphlet, and although we
notice the awful adventures of the heroes of the gallows and guillotine in our progress, we have no wish to pander
to the taste of the illiterate and depraved, but to point a moral that shall leave a trace of some good impression
behind.</p>

<p>As we have placed <span class="smcap">Askern</span> foremost in our list of modern living British hangmen, the most unknown and
least experienced, we shall first give a short biographical notice of his life and professional career.</p>

<p>Except in the performance of their dreadful office, and the associations it brings them into, before and after
every execution, there is nothing in their private antecedents and habits above the common run of men of their
class. No extraordinary genius has ever been manifested by either of our gallows-heroes, beyond the horrible
calling which fate has marked out for them. But under the irresistable spell of an evil destiny, they are compelled
by fate to perform deeds which all other men shudder at, although they know their legal necessity; and
in their endeavours to become proficient in their strangling art, so as to earn the praise of their official superiors,
and the admiration of the multitude, they stand out from the rest of society with more than ordinary prominence,
and in that respect are regarded as the chief of remarkable public characters. From the most reliable information
current amongst the old friends and associates of Askern about York and adjacent districts, also from
officials of the castle, which is now used as a gaol, a career of abject poverty, want of employment, ill-luck in
almost every one of his undertakings, and a too-fast life whenever his chequered destiny placed money, in small
sums at a time, within his power, led him into <i>temptation</i>, and from that temptation came the <i>commission</i> of a deed
which consigned him a prisoner to York Castle, from the sombre scenes of which he never emerged, except as a
convict, whom evil fate had long marked for her own! In charity, we throw a veil over his particular offence, as
our object is only to here show cause and effect, and warn the yet pure and innocent from evil courses.</p>

<p>It was while a convicted prisoner and when an execution was pending without any hangman to do the “job,”
after an unsuccessful application to Calcraft of London, who was then fully engaged, that an offer of pardon was
made to him on condition that he performed the office on the doomed man.</p>

<p>Moved by the love of liberty, which like life is said to be sweet to everyone, and promises of remuneration
and perquisites, Askern accepted without much hesitation the office of public executioner, and to qualify himself
in his new and ominous business, he diligently employed his time (as all others in the same line have done before
him) in tying and knotting several lengths of rope after the hangman’s fashion, and testing their tightening
effects upon an effigy suspended to a rope stretched across the private room where he lodged. To acquire speed
and precision in the tying of a hangman’s “noose,” also in the “turning off and cutting down” without the least
blundering and rousing the execrations of the depraved mobs which generally assemble to view such ghastly
sights, many trials he had to make upon the suspended figure to fit him for the work of the scaffold.</p>

<p>At length the fatal morning came for his first practical essay on the neck of a human being over the top of
the castle wall, and in the presence of a vast hideous-looking concourse of people, who hissed at the culprit when
he appeared; and strange inconsistency, also hooted the man who was employed to execute the bidding of justice
on the object of their detestation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Askern</span>, at a scene so horribie and new to him, trembled, and would have rushed at once from the scaffold
the very moment he had stepped upon it, if he had possessed the power and freedom to do so; but alas! for him
there was no chance, his apprenticeship to the strangling trade must be fulfilled according to the prescribed conditions
previously mentioned.</p>

<p>Therefore, <i>nerveless</i> as he felt, and ready to sink into the death-trap beneath, amongst the machinery of the
drop, he had to summon up all the courage and fortitude which draughts of intoxicating liquor then plentifully
supplied to him, could instil into his drooping frame.</p>

<p>At one bound he approached the pinioned wretch, roughly seized him, placed him under the cross-beam of
the gallows quickly, with blanched features and trembling hands, hurriedly pulled the white cap down over his
livid face, placed the rope over his neck, and drew the noose most scientifically as he thought, in the true Calcraft
style, and as his preceding lessons had taught him; but, lo, and behold! a turnkey had no sooner hastened down
and drawn the bolt that lets fall the flooring on which the murderer stands, and sets him swinging in the air,
than the culprit’s awful convulsions and desperate struggles to clutch the rope and free himself from the tortures
he was suffering, showed the ghastly fact, that his first attempt did not succeed, and that the yelling multitude
around and below, all horror-stricken at the sickening spectacle, were clamoring against the unfortunate
servant of the law! Speedily he had to release the quivering half-strangled wretch, and do his work of hanging
over again, ere death terminated the writhings of the doomed man, and at the same time quieted the unearthly
cries of the heaving and seething crowds of men and women who had come from various distances, near and far,
to behold the great <span class="smcap">National Show</span>!</p>

<p>Subsequent experience “got his hand in” as the saying is, and made him more adroit at strangling, but
except among a very few relatives and old acquaintances, he was a man shunned and despised, and often liable to
insults and desperate encounters in public company, when once the whisper went round that he was the hangman
of <span class="smcap">York Castle</span>.</p>

<p>Another unhappy being, fated to follow the same horrible vocation, is <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, of Dudley. On the outskirts
of the town there used to be seen the old half-tumbled down cottage, surrounded by a marshy piece of ground,
where “Dudley Smith,” as he is often called, resided at the time he took it into his head to become a second rival
to London’s famous hangman. The news of <span class="smcap">Askern’s</span> exploits gave <span class="smcap">Smith</span> courage, but made <span class="smcap">Calcraft</span> only
laugh and wonder how many more fools, ambitious of a black notoriety, were going to compete with him. Events
soon followed to settle the question, and afford <span class="smcap">Smith</span> the opportunity he sought.</p>

<p>“Red-handed guilt, the child of woe” then made rapid progress, and cast a gloom over many a household
in Staffordshire, and throughout the adjacent “black country.” The difference of a few guineas settled the
matter in the minds of the authorities of Stafford gaol, and struck the balance against the pecuniary demands of
the skilful <span class="smcap">Calcraft</span>, and in favour of the lesser price of the inexperienced <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, who, however, supplemented
the want of experience with that species of brazen impudence and animal confidence which men of his class
possess. Mentally and physically he was of rougher mould than either of the two former gallows heroes. Nurtured
from birth among miners, the companion of the most illiterate pottery hands, and with bull-dog tastes and
habits, he was well fitted for the office of public executioner. A man being wanted for the coming “job,” he
applied, sent in the “lowest tender,” and was accepted. Visions by day and night now haunted his mind; asleep
or awake the gallows and all its appurtenances dwelt strongly upon his imagination, and flitted before his eyes in
his drunken moments. Coils of rope here, there, and everywhere rose up before him, and sometimes twined about
his own neck in his midnight dreams, like fiery serpents. Time was getting brief, and he must prepare to perform
his task neatly and expeditiously, and in dexterity equal the renowned William Calcraft. So, accordingly, after
being shown the sort of rope he must use, he set himself to the work of experimenting and forming slip knots
round logs of wood, knobs of furniture and fixtures, the tops of his garden rails, and sometimes round his own
neck, close under the ear, and sufficiently tight to satisfy himself that it would answer at the proper time. He
practised also the pinioning process on his “young woman” in secret; who, not at all enamoured at his intended
profession, at first stoutly resisted, but his importunities and determination made her submit to his strange
proceedings.</p>

<p>Without overburdening our confined space with an enumeration of the criminals he afterwards executed at
Stafford and elsewhere, suffice it to say, that after a few blunders and the usual violent outcries of the brutal
multitudes, he became tolerably expert, and was considered a fit assistant to Calcraft, when a change of the law
and private executions were determined upon. As we have been informed in the before quoted narrative of the
first private execution, on account of Calcraft’s great age, and in obedience to the overtures of the authorities,
<span class="smcap">Smith</span> performed the subordinate part of moving the bolt that supported the platform on which the criminal
stood; preliminary, it is supposed, to taking Calcraft’s place, if death or inability should ere long necessitate a
change.</p>

<p>Such a change may be nearer than people suppose, for Calcraft is expected to be a successful applicant for a
retiring pension, on account of his infirmities, now too plainly visible, in which event Smith might have for a
competitor the notorious “<span class="smcap">Long Tom Coffin</span>,” a costermonger of old Clare Market, lately pulled down, and a
quaint character about town, who addressed an epistle in the following form to the authorities of Newgate, which
we give in its original orthography, and “with all its blushing honours” and beauties “thick upon it”:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">“Wild Street, March 1st, 1868.</p>

<p class="noindent">“To the Gaol Committee of Newgate,”</p>

<p>“Gentilmen,&mdash;As Ive heerd Calcraft yure ould hangmon iz goin to leeve iz plaise, Ive just takin the libertee
too ask yu too chuse me, as I am villin too do the jobs on murdrers for the same pay, and vill ever bee punkshal

<p class="sig2">I am Gentilmen,</p>

<p class="sig1">Yure humbel sirvent,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Thomas Coffin</span>.”</p>

<p>“P.S.&mdash;Nevyew by my granmuther’s side to the late Doctur Coffin.”</p>

<p>The secret execution of Wells, the railway porter, at Maidstone, on August 13th, 1868, marks in the criminal
calendar William Calcraft’s disappearance from public life. He will henceforth be surrounded by the mystery
becoming his terrible office, and the rising generation of criminals who take an interest in the matter, will have
to ask their seniors what kind of man he was, and to trust to their imaginations for the picture of him. To no
man probably will this mystery be more welcome than to Calcraft himself. He has shown, on more than one
occasion, that his dread of facing the crowd was equal to his victim’s dread of facing the gallows.</p>

<p>At the execution of the Manchester Fenians, and of Barrett in London, he was seen to manifest more fear
and nervous weakness than any of the men whom he was to put to death. On both occasions he received violent
threatening letters from the fenian friends of the culprits. He therefore shuffled about the prison yard, and
seemed afraid to mount the gallows-steps, while the sweat fell from his face, and stood in large drops upon his
brow. It is a great relief to him for his few remaining years, and a moral gain in every sense to society, to have
lost sight of him; for after all, he constituted perhaps the most revolting part of a public execution. The strong
prejudice, and the intense savage hatred of the crowd against him was, no doubt, a most unjustifiable feeling,
seeing that as the mere instrument of justice and of judgment, he was neither to be hated nor to be loved; but it
existed in such intensity that there was no prospect of its ever being lessened. The effect was extremely injurious
even to the poor kind of morality that public executions were supposed to promote. The passive feeling of awe
with which men might be disposed to look on a criminal going to a righteous doom, was changed into an active
feeling of disgust and horror, when they beheld the man by whom he was publicly strangled; and there was too
much reason to believe that they left the precincts of the gibbet with more of this unjust feeling uppermost in
their minds, than that which open-air executions were meant to inculcate.</p>

<p>All this is now changed by the private system of hanging, but it also destroys every plea for retaining the
use of the gallows, as we have before argued in previous pages.</p>

<p>In sketching the career of Calcraft, much is necessary to be said respecting his predecessor, <span class="smcap">Tom Cheshire</span>,
to whom he acted for some years as an assistant hangman, and who gave him during that time repeated instructions
in the art of putting criminals to death.</p>

<p>The commencement of his professional life reaches back far into the reign of George the Third, when Tom
Cheshire first employed him, and was in the height of his fame. A very remarkable character was old Cheshire,
who used to wear always a snuff-brown coat reaching down to his heels, and on that account was often hooted at
wherever he was seen, as the “snuffy skull thatcher!” Many of the ancient customs of Newgate he was an eye-witness
of, and which will be interesting to mention here.</p>

<p>When the last night of some poor condemned wretch had arrived, at midnight, and from hour to hour, till
the dawn of the execution morning, a bell man used to parade outside the prison walls under the grating of the
condemned cell, and in loud solemn tones accompanied the harsh sounds of his bell with his warning-cries, to
“prepare for death.” With a blush of shame for our forefathers, we are obliged to confess that, <span class="smcap">murder by
law</span> on the gallows was then so common for burglary, highway robbery, forgery, horse and sheep stealing, shop-lifting
to the value of forty shillings, and other minor offences, that “hanging Monday” was regularly looked for,
after every Old Bailey sessions, when a batch of males and females, sometimes amounting to half a dozen, would
be hung up like so many dogs and cats on a Monday morning, although only found guilty and sentenced on the
preceding Friday. Simple stealing from a house or the person was then oftener punished with death than were
murderous offences. And so awfully unscrupulous were the “Bow-street runners,” as the officers of police were
termed, that the innocent used to be “planted” with stolen property, entrapped, sworn positively against, and
put to death for the sake of the £40 “blood money” then given for every one capitally convicted. Then the
horror of the “condemned cell, and pew, and press yard” were kept continually going, and the blood-thirsty
monsters afterwards held their nightly saturnalias together, with spies, informers, bawdy-house pimps of both
sexes, and the master and deputy-hangman amongst them; who revelled and toasted the success of their trade
of blood-spilling. Then also, the “press yard” witnessed every sessions the torturing of its many youthful
victims by the lead-knotted lash; and the “press room” resounded with the piercing shrieks of a prisoner undergoing
the punishment awarded to those who refused to plead. Whenever a prisoner at the bar declined to say
whether he was guilty or not guilty (a formality required by the law before he could be tried), he was taken to
the “press room,” laid on the stone floor naked, and with arms and legs extended, chained fast by the wrists and
ancles; and a stout board was placed on the front of his body, on which heavy iron weights, one by one, were
gradually placed, after every time he was asked if he would plead to the question first put to him, “guilty or not
guilty?” Some poor tortured wretches, after a certain number of ponderous weights, never less than half-hundreds
or hundreds, had been heaped upon them, would be terrified into pleading and standing the chance of
their trial; but others would be obstinately dumb till such a pile of weights was added, that they were, according
to the sentence of the law, crushed to death! The murderer’s pew in the chapel, on the sabbath day, often presented
a spectacle, that once seen, never was forgotten. While the late Rev. Dr. Cotton, then the prison chaplain,
was preaching the “condemned sermon” one time scowling assassins deep-dyed with the blood of many victims
would be seen grouped together; at another time youth and innocence, wrongfully condemned to die a felon’s
death on the gallows (as history has since proved), through perjury, or misconstrued circumstances and uncertain
evidence. Amongst these we must not forget the fair and beautiful Eliza Fenning, a virtuous maiden servant of
a tradesman’s family in Fleet Street, who suffered death on the public gibbet for an offence which she called God
to witness that she was totally innocent of! She was convicted on doubtful circumstantial evidence of attempting
to poison the whole family, by putting arsenic into the flour of some dumplings she made for their dinner. All
her solemn asseverations of innocence availed her not, and the best of characters was entirely useless: sentenced
to die she was, and she was ruthlessly hanged by her fair neck, before a vast sympathising multitude of men,
women, and children in the Old Bailey, all melted to tears, and crying out “shame,” “shame!”</p>

<p>The beauteous innocent creature appeared on the gallows platform in a new white dress from head to foot,
as spotless as her own purity; and we doubt not her soul, the moment it was released by the executioner’s vile
hands, was caught up by attending angels and carried to the haven of eternal bliss.</p>

<p>Long after it was too late to wipe out the stain of her judicial murder, her master’s son confessed on his
death bed that he secretly mixed the arsenic in the flour she used, during her brief absence from the kitchen, as
an act of revenge for refusing to submit to his embraces.</p>

<p>Tom Cheshire and Newgate has witnessed other ghastly scenes, and his predecessor has had adventures with
“Sixteen-string-Jack, Jerry Abershaw, Jonathan Wild, Jack Shepherd, Betsy the bank-note forger and foot-pad,
who was half executed and restored to life; when the <span class="smcap">CONDEMNED</span> used to go in an open cart, sitting on their
coffins, from Newgate all through Holborn to a public half-way house in St. Giles’s, where they were allowed to
stop and drink their “parting draught” with their friends, and be presented with their “last nosegay,” and then
resume their procession through Oxford Road, and at the top of it, in the open space facing the gates of Hyde
Park, near the turnpike that then existed, to be at once executed on Tyburn’s three-corner’d gibbet.</p>

<p>Passing to later times, <span class="smcap">Cheshire</span> and his man Calcraft knew something about the noted Dr. Brooks and
the dreadful secrets of old surgeon’s hall at the back of Newgate. Subjects for dissection being very scarce,
“<span class="smcap">BODY-SNATCHERS</span>,” sometimes called “<i>resurrectionists</i>” used to watch funerals during the day time in the church-yards
of London, mark where the youngest and plumpest subjects were interred, and at night, with digging tools
take them up and bag them in sacks, which they would speedily convey to a hired hackney coach standing
conveniently near, and drive off with them to the said hall, or to St. Bartholomew’s, according to orders. As body-snatching
did not always supply enough subjects for the numerous doctors and students who required them for
lectures and experiments, a viler class of offenders sprang to way-lay the friendless and unfortunate, entice them
into some lonely out of way house surrounded by vacant ground walls, and there poison and smother them. These
horrible villains were called Burkers, who contrived for a long time to sell the bodies of their victims undetected
for large sums, as persons who had died naturally and been buried. At last a poor Italian boy who exhibited
white mice in the streets, was burked by Bishop, May, and Williams, in a lone house in Bethnal-green, and one
night was offered at Bartholomew’s hospital. The doctor to whom they took it, feeling certain after a minute
examination, that the corpse had died a violent death, quietly sent for the officers of justice, and gave them into
custody. They were tried and found guilty on the clearest evidence of Italians who identified the boy, and
were hanged by Calcraft and his master amidst the loudest execrations ever heard in the precincts of Newgate.</p>

<p>During the earlier times of that awful looking gail, the classification and administration were so loose as to
render it a perfect <span class="smcap">HELL ON EARTH</span>. Depravity, ribaldry, drunkenness, gambling and debauchery there reigned
unchecked in its dark dungeon, between gaolers and the lowest of their male and female prisoners. The latter sex
often times exchanged clothes with their keepers, when the govener was, at night, fast asleep, and in their cells
they carrried on whatever lewd revels they had a fancy for, and made a pandemonium of the prison. At the
death of Cheshire, Calcraft became principal executioner. He was previously a private watchman at Reid’s
brewery, Liquorpond Street, and by trade a lady’s shoemaker. He is also celebrated as a first-class rabbit-fancier,
whose breed has won prizes, and unknown, has graced the festive board of many London families. At
the Tiger public house, corner of Devizes Street, near the Rosemary Branch, Hoxton, next door to his old residence
in his younger days, he used to meet great numbers of his brother snobs, rabbit-breeders, and skittle
players, and there held jollifications and played skittles with them. On account of the prejudice of the
neighbours, and the too-great freedom of impudent boys in calling out “Jack Ketch,” his habit was to
go out very early in the morning and after dark. He is married, and is the parent of a goodly number of sons
and daughters, morally brought up and schooled, who have sometimes, been unjustly annoyed by ignorent
people on account of their unfortunate parentage. To show the full force of this prejudice we will mention a
curious circumstance that happened to one of his daughters.</p>

<p>She was accustomed to meet and court a young mechanic at a friend’s house. One night a supper was appointed
to be held there, and the sweetheart had promise of a good merry-making with mutual acquaintances of
both sexes, not one of whom knew Miss Calcraft by her paternal name. Through some mysterous cause we have
never had explained, just as all were comfortably seated around the smoking viands on the table, and were pledging
the lovers and each other in preliminary bumpers of beer and gin, strange footsteps were heard on the stairs,
followed by a knock at the door, and when it was opened, the whole company, especially Miss Calcraft’s lover,
were suddenly petrified with horror. No sooner was the fatal name pronounced and a recognition passed between
father and daughter, than the young man at one bound cleared the table, rushed down the stairs, ran fast away
from the house and was seen no more; thus proving again to the deserted hangman’s daughter, that “the course
of true love never runs smooth.”</p>

<p>A parallel to the iniquities of the old Bow Street runners are to be found in the records of our modern police
force of London. “Jack Ketch’s warren” was well supplied by police scoundrels from many quarters of the
poverty stricken districts. One of the most infamous was the “prig’s haunt” in Tyndal’s Buildings, Gray’s Inn
Lane, inhabited by low Irish, where <span class="smcap">King</span>, a policeman in disguise, attended daily when off duty, to teach pocket-picking
and all the arts of burglary to poor outcast boys. Between experiments with various instruments, and
lessons on the way to use them, a coat was swung across a line, and the young ones were shown how to pick the
pocket single-handed when a thief was by himself, and when they went together in twos and threes. As fast as
they became adepts in the art and went into the streets to obtain their living by it, King, who always knew their
walks, watched them in his uniform, and the moment they committed a robbery, pounced upon them and procured
their conviction, for which he obtained the praise of his superiors for extraordinary vigilance, and rewards,
besides court-fees at the sessions. At last this vile thief-trainer became too clever; he was denounced by some
boys sharper than himself, and some of his honester brother-constables took the clue up, unravelled it to the end,
and on the clearest evidence got him sentenced to penal servitude for life. A more recent proof, while we are
penning this, has come out, that perjury is still rife in the Metropolitan police force. Three policemen have been
wrongfully procuring the conviction of a drover on the charge of stealing several sheep from a field at Tottenham,
and have received their “blood money” from the County of Middlesex funds. Since their poor victim has been
suffering incarceration, the real thief, at the trial of one of his confederates, has confessed to his own guilt, and
declared the entire innocence of the man formerly sworn to by the said policemen. May justice soon overtake
them.</p>

<p>Returning to Calcraft and his latter days, we have to congratulate our readers upon his religious conversion,
and regular Sunday attendance with his wife, at a church near Poole-street, Islington. He has long ceased to
love his office and make money by sales of the clothes of the numerous culprits, and bits of the ropes that hanged
them. The ancient ceremony of swearing in the executioner was an awful one. Amidst a collection of ropes,
fetters and handcuffs, with his hand upon the bible, he was required to solemnly swear that he would execute
every criminal condemned to die, without favouring father or mother, or any friend whatsoever; and when he
had taken the horrible oath he was dismissed with the ominous words&mdash;“<span class="smcap">GET THEE HENCE WRETCH!</span>”</p>

<p>The latest performance of Calcraft is reported below, and shows that the first private execution at Newgate
was like the one at Maidstone, privately barbarous and publicly useless.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At nine o’clock in the morning of September 8th, the first private execution in London took place in the interior of Newgate Prison. The culprit was
Alexander Arthur Mackay, a youth of only eighteen years of age, who, on the 8th of May last murdered a woman Emma Grossmith in whose service he was, at
11, Artillery-passage, Norton Folgate. It now only remains to tell how he expiated his crime upon the scaffold in the presence not of a roaring, surging mob,
but in the solitude of a prison, and before a few persons, whose number did not much exceed a score.</p>

<p>Inside the gaol the scene was solemn to the last degree. The representatives of the morning newspapers whose duty it was to witness the execution
were admitted to Newgate at half-past eight, and after traversing several gloomy corridors found themselves in an inclosed yard near the prison chapel, in
front of the scaffold. A few words will enable the reader to picture for himself the scene.</p>

<p>The yard is a square one, entered by a wicket gate at the south-east corner, and in the corner to the north-west stands the scaffold. In the south-west
corner, near the grating through which prisoners undergoing punishment hold converse with their friends at periods arranged for by the prison rules, is a
space railed off for the representatives of the press, and standing at invervals of a few yards apart are men of the City police, occupying the remainder of the
yard. Behind the scaffold the prison buildings rear their massive walls, and from the roof peers down upon the solemn scene below a stolid warder stationed
there in order that, so soon as the ghastly business is at an end, he may signal the man in whose hands are the ropes to hoist the black flag, as a witness to
the outside world that justice is satisfied; on the opposite side of the yard are other prison buildings with grated windows, but no outward sign of the life
within, while flanking the yard north and south are walls&mdash;the one is topped by a terrible cheveaux de frise, and over the other hangs suspended a large cloth,
the sound of whose rustling as shaken by the wind&mdash;it beat against the prison wall,&mdash;was as the flapping wing of a huge bird of prey. The silent expectation
of the twenty minutes spent in that dreadful yard was the most painful experience of the present writer’s life. Absence of sound when a man is alone in the
heart of a trackless forest is said by travellers to be fearfully oppressive, but the involuntary silence of twenty men waiting the entrance of the messengers of
death and their victim becomes painful to the last degree. Sometimes there is a slight murmur heard from the outside of the prison, with now and again the
clanking of a latch or the grating of a bolt within the gaol itself, and occasionally a low hum of conversation in the yard&mdash;these are the only sounds heard, and
they only serve to intensify the oppressiveness of the silent intervals that intervene. What was going on within the prison during this time was not known to
the representatives of the press. Under the new Act of Parliament they are excluded from what was known as the pinioning room, and only see the very last
scene of all, an alteration very agreeable to the feelings of gentlemen upon whom is imposed a most painful duty. They learned after the execution that
Mackay had since his condemnation conducted himself with great decorum, had frequently expressed his great sorrow for the crime he had committed, and his
perfect readiness to die. The poor youth, we were told, lost his own mother when he was about the same age as one of his victim’s children, and this deepened
in his own mind the intense feelings of piognant regret he seemed to experience between his sentence being pronounced and carried into effect. He was most
attentive to the ministrations of the Rev. Mr. Jones, ordinary of Newgate, and took the sacrament at his hands on Sunday, The condemned youth slept
soundly until about six o’clock in the morning, when he rose and remained in communion with his spiritual adviser until the last. So much for the interior of
the prison; outside the silence remained unbroken, save by the sounds of which we have spoken, until within a quarter of an hour of nine, when from the
neighbouring church of St. Sepulchre a passing bell began to toll, and a slightly increased murmur from the outside world reached the ears of those who
waited within the prison. At about this time Mr Sheriff M’Arthur, with his under sheriffs, Messrs Roche and Davidson Mr. Jonas, the governor; and Mr.
Gibson, the surgeon of Newgate, entered the yard, and having satisfied themselves that all the arrangements were complete, retired, leaving the space again to
the reporters and policemen, one of the latter body having some few minutes earlier turned sick and left the yard. This almost unbearable suspense lasted
until the clocks in the neighbourhood were heard to strike the hour, and then the clanking of a latch behind the black screen surrounding the scaffold was
followed by the appearance of the Rev. Mr. Jones, who supported the doomed man as he ascended the few steps leading from the ground to the drop. The
chaplain, whose voice trembled with emotion, read the Litany from the Church of England Prayer-book, and Mackay joined with a loud, clear voiee in the
responses, his voice being heard distinctly over the yard, even after he was capped and noosed. Just at this supreme moment the young man’s firmness seemed
about to forsake him, and he tottered as though to fall, but the hand of the chaplain laid upon his arm sustained him, and in another second the trap on which
the unhappy man was standing fell, and he hung suspended. The fall was a very short one, and signs of life were visible for a longer time after the bolt was
drawn than we remember to have seen on any similar occasion. As soon as possible every one concerned in the ghastly business was glad to make his escape
from this last act in a doleful drama. To the spectators, judging from our own experience, and the appearance of many persons present, nothing could have
been more terrible than this sight of a man, calmly, methodically strangled under shadow of a prison wall, without any of the frothy excitement that has up
to within a very short time formed part of an execution ceremony. Few things could be more impressive, so far as the outside spectators were concerned (by
reason of its fearful suggestiveness) than the silent running up of a black flag from the gaol wall just as the murderer passed down into the valley of the
shadow of death; and nothing we should say could have been more awful than the sight of those four high, hard, pitiless walls to the wretch brought forth to
die. Such is an account of the first execution of a murderer in London that has taken place out of sight of such as chose to brave the horrore of an execution
crowd in order to see a fellow-creature die a shameful death.</p>

<p>The body, after hanging an hour, was cut down, and a coroner’s inquest, as prescribed by the Act of Parliament, was held in the course of the afternoon,
previous to burying it.</p></div>

<p>The last personage we shall record here as a fit companion to all the before-mentioned, is <span class="smcap">Sanson</span>, the renowned
<span class="smcap">HERO OF THE GUILLOTINE</span>. On the outskirts of old Paris, in a small neat cottage overlooking the banks
of the Seine, surrounded by palings at the front, and thick hawthorn hedges at the sides and back, lives secluded
from vulgar gaze a descendant of three generations of the Sansons, who from father to son have inherited the
office of public executioner. He is a grim-looking old man of strong build; and is complacent to all visitors whose
curiosity leads them to see and converse with him, and view his curious cabinet of murderers’ relics and criminals’
curiosities; and who make their request with becoming civility. He is full of anecdotes about the exploits
of his ancestors at chopping off the heads of Louis the XVI, Maria Antonette, Charlotte Corday, the
authoress of the famous saying “O! liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name,” as she was about to put
her neck under the guillotine knife. He will exhibit at the same time, models of guillotines, instruments of
torture, amongst them spokes of the blood-stained breaking wheel of former days, locks of the hair of various
nobles and their ladies, rings, brooches, and other trinkets of the victims of the bloody Robespierre, with pieces
of the robes and surplices of the bishops and priests who were then brought out of dungeons and guillotined in
multitudes early every morning for weeks together, till the ground where the scaffold stood ran with blood. A
few skulls and finger-bones of remarkable persons he will also show, and tell how he obtained them. We will
now spare our reader’s feelings, and conclude by hoping that the day is not far off, when the awful adventures of
the heroes of the gallows and guillotine will be numbered among the things of the past.</p>

<p class="titlepage">THE END.</p>
